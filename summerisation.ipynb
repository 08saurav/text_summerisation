      "{'articles': [' cnn     the year was  . it was the dawn of the soft drink machine, the first tube of the lincoln tunnel ... and the shopping cart. inventor sylvan goldmans prototype for the shopping cart was nothing more than two wire baskets attached to a folding chair, but it was the start of what would become a supermarket staple.  when it first came on the scene, customers were reluctant to use the cart. but by the  s, they were so ubiquitous that a new problem had arisen   the rogue shopping cart.  chicago supermarket owner anthony dinolfo was so enraged by the volume of stolen shopping carts popping up in places decidedly not supermarkets  in auto repair shops, peoples basements and at the bottom of rivers  that he went on a crusade to return them to their rightful owners. in  , he deemed february return shopping carts to the supermarket month.  dinolfo died in  , but his crusade reappears each february on various websites and internet forums, and was even acknowledged by the american . census bureau. when we brought this to the attention of the cnn ireport community, our contributors mentioned that until now, they had never noticed how prevalent wayward shopping carts were.  while it may be easy to write off dinolfos crusade as just the hysterical rant of a disgruntled business owner, retailers report cart theft to be a costly problem. shopping carts cost anywhere from    to    each, according to brett osterfeld of gatekeeper systems.  retailers find customers\\' ambivalence toward the issue frustrating, but most people ca not  help but think that there are greater causes to raise awareness about.  \"am i supposed to really feel sorry for the grocers \" asked jeremy nix from denver.  the great cart robbery  ron fong, president and ceo of the california grocers association, found that stores that report the greatest losses are located in neighborhoods and cities where few people own a car, but still need an efficient way to carry their groceries home.  once the shoppers are finished, the carts rarely return to the store. fong said that hes seen many innovative uses for shopping carts, such as portable barbecue grills, lounge chairs and even shelters. he noted that many homeless people use them to transport their belongings.  in november, hawaii state lawmaker tom brower attempted to clean up the states homeless problem by taking a sledgehammer to abandoned shopping carts. hawaii has the countrys highest rate of homeless per capita; brewer said his solution was meant to encourage them to seek out shelters.  \"i get a lot of complaints about stolen and abandoned shopping carts in waikiki, and i was thinking as a public servant, \\'what can i do that would be practical and i can literally do overnight \\' \" brower told cnn affiliate kitv. \"i am  not doing anything different than doing a community cleanup, or what the citys administration has tried to do with the issue of people illegally camping on the streets.\"  supermarkets and community members are not  the only ones american et about the stray carts. the city of santa ana, california, reported an annual cost of   ,  to retrieve abandoned shopping carts from local streams and rivers. across the country, john long, president of the maryland nonprofit clean bread and cheese creek, said that volunteers have removed more than   shopping carts from the creek that drains into the chesapeake bay since  .  \"they create an environmental hazard by trapping wildlife and causing artificial dams along the stream, which lead to flooding and erosion,\" long said.  stores are working to contain the problem through the use of cart containment systems    the wheels lock when they reach the boundary of the stores parking lot    and by hiring companies to locate and return the carts for a fee.  and yet, it is  not hard to find plenty of shopping carts in the wild ...  scroll through the gallery to see some of the spots where carts have turned up.   highlight  february is return shopping carts to the supermarket month   highlight  rogue shopping carts have been found used as grills, chairs and shelters   highlight  stores report annual losses of more than    million globally due to cart theft   highlight  stores enlist cart security systems in order to contain the problem', ' cnn     i still remember the chill that came over me the day my middle school history teacher showed the class a documentary about the holocaust.  millions of jews were systematically isolated, corralled and eventually murdered by the nazi regime. it is  a horrible blemish on the history of mankind, one that is rarely brought up lightly. it is  one that is recognized in museums, dramatized in film and taught in middle schools like the one i went to nearly   years ago.  and yet, despite my continuous exposure to the retelling of the holocaust, it was not  until i was in my mid  s that i learned hitler had also isolated, corralled and murdered gay men and lesbians during this time as well.  right now i can hear the voices ask  what does it matter   i had graduated from high school before i learned some of the greatest voices during the harlem renaissance and civil rights movement    lorraine hansberry, james baldwin, bayard rustin    were members of the lgbt community.  it was in graduate school when i first heard the name harvey milk. i was a working journalist before i was told about dave kopay, the former nfl running back who came out in his   autobiography, \"the dave kopay story.\"  and now the chorus of voices ask  so what   over the years, i am proud to say i have amassed a decent personal library. most of the books are about history  presidential biographies, wars, social justice movements.  and yet, it was only this week    thanks to longtime civil rights activist david mixner    that i learned congress once debated passing a law forcing gay men to wear tattoos and corralling those who were hiv positive into internment camps. yes, just like the jews. just like the gay men who were next to those jews in nazi germany but have since disappeared from our history books.  it is here where the cynic wonders  who needs to know   with the overturning of \"do not  ask, do not  tell,\" the sweeping changes in marriage equality, the presence of open lgbt people working in the white house, on tv, even in professional sports, there may be some who believe the heart of homophobia no longer beats. much in the same way others believed the burning of bras slayed sexism and the election of president barack obama was racisms death knell.  one of the most powerful ceos on the planet has announced he is a proud gay man, and while i may be hesitant to characterized apples tim cook proclamation \"brave,\" it is nonetheless important.  he is here.  just as hansberry and rustin and milk were there    working for the greater good, changing the course of global history, woven into the fabric of humanity.  the voices may ask  what difference does it make  let the absence of lgbt people in our retelling of our history be the reply.  for if being gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender truly did not matter, why then must we fight to have our contributions recognized   why then, when california became the first state to require our stories be included in the history books, was it met with resistance in    that conservative state assemblyman tim donnelly described the day the bill was signed into law \"sad\" as if simply learning that a group of people existed infringed upon his constitutional rights.  to be honest, cooks announcement is no great shock to anyone who has been paying attention to the rumor mill. but by owning his truth in such a public fashion, cook is not only rebuking the tendency many lgbt baby boomers still have to hide, but he is also refusing to allow his silence to render him hidden.  when the middle school history teachers speak of him, they will have his full story to share.  going forward, chants of \"who cares \" will accompany nearly every person of note who chooses to come out publicly. even among lgbt people, shoulder shrugs will not be that uncommon, as if debates about internment camps happened in the  s and not the  s.  yes, the country is different, and being gay is no longer shocking.  but it is a mistake to confuse that progress with cooks announcement having no importance. for far too long, the story of the lgbt community has been scrubbed from our education, contributions erased and existence relegated to the poorly lit corner of bookstores under the banner \"alternative lifestyle.\"  we are not a \"lifestyle.\" we are a people, and we were there.  and we are here.   highlight  lz granderson was an adult when he learned gay people were also nazi victims   highlight  he also learned key members of the harlem renaissance, civil rights movement were lgbt   highlight  why does it matter  granderson says it is  crucial gay people not be scrubbed from history   highlight  it is  important to know the full story of people such as apple ceo tim cook, he says', ' cnn     swedens culture minister was feeling the heat wednesday after a weekend art exhibit in which she cut up a cake baked into the shape of a cartoonishly stereotyped african woman.  a group representing swedes of african descent has called for lena adelsohn liljeroth to resign over that it called a racist caricature. but liljeroth defended her participation, saying the cake was designed to \"challenge the traditional image of racism.\"  \"while the symbolism in the piece is despicable, it is unfortunate and highly regrettable that the presentation has been interpreted as an expression of racism by some,\" liljeroth said in a statement issued by her office. \"the artistic intent was the exact opposite.\"  the artist who designed the cake, makode linde, is of african descent himself and said the piece was aimed at condemning the practice of female genital mutilation. pictures from the sunday exhibition showed liljeroth slicing into the cake from the \"genitals\" and feeding it to linde, who told cnn he made himself the head of the figure and screamed in pain when it was cut.  \"i did not  intend for anyone to feel singled out or embarrassed,\" he said. \"but we are  talking about female genital mutilation    is there any comfortable or cozy way to talk about it \"  liljeroth was scheduled to meet with representatives of the national association for afro swedes, which has demanded she should step down, on wednesday evening. the

recreation in nevada.  it is  the classic game of dodge ball, but these are not  fifth graders during pe class in sparks, nevada.  the childhood sport of dodge ball made a comeback four years ago in this bedroom community among adults in their  s and  s    and even a few players who reached retirement.  now, hundreds of working professionals, doctors, lawyers and teachers congregate at the local recreation center for a dose of dodge ball on sunday nights.  \"i think a lot of it goes back to trying to stay young,\" said tony pehle, recreation supervisor in sparks, who started the dodge ball program after being inspired by the   ben stiller movie \"dodgeball  a true underdog story.\"  \"they might be adults, but they still like to play and have fun.\"  has peter pan syndrome come to stay  from playing dodge ball to jumping double dutch and competing in rock paper scissors, adult men and women, from urban nests to rural towns, are reveling in games and activities once thought to be childs play.  the   world yo yo contest in orlando, florida, this weekend  august     is all grown up, attracting more than   adult competitors, who can showcase dizzying tricks with the flick of a finger. later in the month, hundreds of adults outfitted in pirate and animal costumes will race their homebuilt vehicles for oregons annual portland adult soapbox derby, a crafty activity that began for youths in the  s.  \"once a year, i get to build something for the kid in me,\" says jason hogue, a   year old carpenter, who has participated in the race for eight years. last year, he constructed a car shaped like a hammerhead shark. \"we get to use our creativity and get excited with our friends.\"  whether they are  done to seek refuge from the daily grind or to provide nostalgia for youthful days    or they are  a product of what some experts say is a generation that ca not  grow up    these juvenile pastimes are getting more popular. for example, adult viewership of the nickelodeon show \"spongebob squarepants\" swelled by   percent from   to  , officials say.  the world adult kickball association, one of the largest kickball organizations, has spread its tentacles to   states as well a soldier division in iraq. waka kickball began as a casual game between a few young single friends in their  s in washington, d.c. now, the games appeal to tens of thousands of adults, many of them yuppies wanting a quick escape from the stresses of their first   k , mortgage and job.  \"i played soccer growing up, and i like competition,\" says avid kickball player marlon lewinter,  , of new york city. lewinter, a public relations executive, usually plays the position of center with a bunch of producers, writers and analysts in their late  s. they named their team chipwich nation after they scarfed down the cookies and ice cream treat at a bar after a game one night.  \"sometimes when it is  [the score] two to one in a kickball came, i get the jitters,\" he says.  the economic bind also creates a favorable environment for adults to latch onto simple childrens games and sports. with players who are trapped in a world of layoffs and job freezes, these adult leagues, contests and tournaments are the equivalent of sandbox time for children. they can make new friends and go for a beer after the game. these activities are also budget friendly, costing less than    to join for several months of play    much less than a golf club membership.  since the recession, duncan toys, one of the biggest yo yo manufacturers in the united states, has seen sales spike. a company official noticed many of the adults who purchased yo yos tried to get the same models they owned as kids.  \"nowadays, everything is taken so seriously that people revert to something like playing with a yo yo,\" says mike mcbride, a   year old multimedia designer who picked up the activity shortly after college. mcbride, who will compete in the orlando world yo yo contest, says the activity helps him relieve stress. \"theres no pressure.\"  in  , christopher noxon, in his book \"rejuvenile,\" explored why adults fancy childhood pursuits like kickball, cartoons and cupcakes. beginning with generation x adults in the  s, the group began to shift from the norms of the hierarchal corporate ladder, and the age of marriage began to steadily climb.  soon, juvenile activities that had been regarded as silly became hip. quirky became cool, and more organized teams, groups and competitions for playground sports and childlike hobbies emerged.  \"our whole idea of adulthood has changed,\" says noxon. \"we value flexibility and creativity, and these are things kids are good at. it is  brought us back to what we had as children.\"  but it is not  just the younger generations that clutch leftovers from their youth or become interested in child like activities. grandparents in their  s and  s still collect roomfuls of model train sets, romanticizing the days when the only way to travel was by choo choo. women in their  s acquire american girl dolls that stir fond memories of reading the novels during childhood.  psychology experts say it should not  be a surprise that the affinity for childhood hobbies and activities extends across generations. after all, americans have long had an obsession with youth. to be young is associated with being fun, vibrant and active.  in the internet age, finding ones inner child has never been easier, with the proliferation of social networks such as facebook or web sites like meetup.com, where users can create groups and meeting times for activities. on the site, groups of adults organize scavenger hunts in atlanta, georgia, and action figure discussions in new york city.  \"this is a generation of people who are far less homogenous and more niche oriented,\" says judith sills, a clinical psychologist who works with young adults. \"they can bond around their quirky differences. ten years ago,

the white house, he decided not to. why  because the families and communities of   million american . residents were still waiting years for president obama to fulfill his promise of immigration reform. and they are still waiting, and have been left feeling betrayed by the failure of this administration to act.  the meeting to discuss american . immigration policy in   followed what was dubbed the \"trail of dreams\" walk by four immigrant college students, including sousa rodriguez, from miami to washington to call attention to the plight of the undocumented in the united states. the  ,  mile walk took place as the number of deportations was hitting historic highs, numbers that have resulted in some   million immigrants being deported. why are we still waiting for change  the recent election results are sufficient proof of the folly of the obama administrations approach.  after all, the congressional budget office determined in june   that immigration reform would boost economic output and could help cut federal budget deficits by    billion over the next   years. but just as important as the lost economic benefits of the failure to act is the human cost. in our ongoing research on undocumented youth and their mothers living in florida, we find harrowing patterns of fear, exploitation and dehumanization. denying opportunities for lawful status results in barriers to employment, physical and social mobility, education and health, and the lack of opportunities has a particularly troubling impact on immigrants\\' mental and emotional well being.  true, the deferred action for childhood arrivals, or daca, has helped those young adults who are eligible. but our research suggests their families need relief from deportation, too, and cannot afford to continue waiting for the president to deliver on his promises.  the reality is that every single day there is a human cost  separated families, deteriorating health, childhood trauma and economic insecurity. these human costs in turn have ripple effects that chip away at the enormous contributions that immigrants make to our economy and communities.  take the case of \"bobby,\" an   year old immigrant who arrived in the united states with his parents from peru when he was  . in spite of daca, which granted bobby and other young people like him a temporary work permit and drivers license, the benefits of this program did not extend to his undocumented mother battling breast cancer, nor his father who was unable to find employment that would afford him health benefits. bobby recently shared with us that at the end of last month, ineligible for health insurance and unable to afford the medical attention she needed and deserved, his mother passed away.  \"we live in a world so spiteful some of us could fall off and no one would notice,\" bobby had told us before his mother died.  we send our condolences to bobbys family and loved ones. but sadly, his is not an isolated case; communities across the nation are losing people every day, not just through government inaction, but through policies that are actively separating families through detention and deportation, despite the many positive contributions immigrants are making to american . society.  it is long past time for the president to take unambiguous action to prevent further harm to immigrants and their families    harm that can be easily avoided by providing them with legal status.  what does this mean in practical terms  for a start, the president should implement broad and inclusive administrative relief from deportation to parents of daca recipients and other hardworking immigrants who are contributing to our economy and communities. this is the only way to ensure that families like bobbys do not continue paying the price for the failure of congress to pass meaningful immigration reform when they had the opportunity.  providing legal status to hardworking immigrants could have allowed bobbys father to attain a job with health benefits that could have saved bobbys mothers life. and while the president cannot bring bobbys mother back, it is not too late to help millions of other immigrants and american . citizens who are fighting every day to keep their families together and their communities safe.  america needs broad based action on immigration reform. it is not just the right thing to do economically    it will also save lives.   highlight    million waiting on immigration reform, say elizabeth aranda, isabel sousa rodriguez   highlight  midterm results show folly of

meant to subdue with a taser pleaded not guilty tuesday to a charge of second degree manslaughter.  at the hearing, the judge granted robert bates permission to go to the bahamas for a family vacation.  that decision prompted a response from the family of eric harris, the man bates killed.  \"we are not surprised that mr. bates pled not guilty.  we are, however, surprised that mr. bates would choose to go on a vacation to the bahamas during this tumultuous time.  whether intended or not, mr. bates\\' vacationing in the bahamas at this time sends a message of apathy with respect to

accidental. he has apologized to the harris family, as has sheriff stanley glanz.  the lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that bates was not  qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he would  made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff.  the tulsa world newspaper reported some supervisors in the tulsa county sheriffs office

to surge with the rainy season approaching.  a man carries a relative in a wheelbarrow to a cholera clinic in harare on tuesday.  bemoaning zimbabwes decline is a familiar refrain for the embattled head of the movement for democratic change. his most recent remarks, however, were backed by former president carter, who returned from a five day trip to neighboring south africa this week and declared zimbabwe \"a basket case.\"  tsvangirai also expressed frustration with attempts to form a unity government between his group and the ruling zanu pf party. he said he has asked that south african ex president thabo mbeki recuse himself as mediator between the two parties.  the zimbabwean government quickly countered tsvangirais allegations that president robert mugabe and zanu pf were responsible for the problems gripping the country.  \"the government is very committed to ensure that the humanitarian crisis is addressed. it would be wrong for the mdc to blame it on the government,\" foreign affairs minister simbarashe mumbengegwi said.  addressing tsvangirais allegations that cholera deaths could soon top   a day and that the mugabe led government seems intent on covering it up, mumbengegwi noted that zimbabwe is not the only country where cholera is a problem.  watch why world leaders call the situation in zimbabwe shocking â»  \"no government would want its people to suffer. cholera is not peculiar to zimbabwe,\" he said. \"we hear it is now in south africa, too, but we cannot relax because of that. we have to fight it as zimbabweans.\"  a report in the state run herald newspaper wednesday said the government has kicked off an information campaign to inform citizens of \"the dos and do not s to combat the disease.\"  the government is also drilling boreholes to find clean, subterranean water that can be pumped to the surface for drinking and bathing, the herald reported.  the world health organization said last week that almost   people have died of cholera since august and more than  ,  cases have been reported.  tsvangirai said wednesday that conditions would worsen this month as the rainy season brings steamy downpours to much of zimbabwe, especially the eastern mountain forests.  carter, former united nations . secretary general kofi annan and graca machel, wife of former south africa president nelson mandela    all of whom belong to a group of world leaders called the elders    had hoped to visit zimbabwe on their recent trip to the region but were denied visas, according to tsvangirai and a statement from the carter center.  \"mr. mugabe would prefer that the suffering that he and zanu pf have caused, and continue to cause, remains in the dark,\" tsvangirai said in a statement, adding that because the movement for democratic change and zanu pf cannot form a partnership after months of wrangling, \"the mdc must instead work with those zimbabwean organizations, groups and individuals to address the humanitarian crisis.\"  the humanitarian problems illustrate the political quagmire in zimbabwe, where a power sharing agreement that mugabe and tsvangirai signed in september has yet to take effect.  carter issued a statement tuesday condemning what he said was harares decision to renege on an agreement to allow him, annan and machel into the country. he also offered a damning assessment of the mugabe regime.  \"after almost three decades of governmental corruption, mismanagement and oppression, zimbabwe has become a basket case, an embarrassment to the region and a focus of international concern and condemnation,\" he said.  denied passage to zimbabwe, carter, annan and machel were left to consult with regional leaders    including tsvangirai, botswana president ian khama and south africa president kgalema motlanthe    as well as united nations officials, nongovernmental organizations and zimbabwes civil leaders.  \"we had a complete and balanced agenda and more frank discussions than would have been possible in the oppressive and restrained environment of harare,\" carter said in his statement.  carter said he learned of conditions in which the official inflation rate has soared to about   million percent while thousands of zimbabweans stand in line for their daily allowance of about   cents a day    from their own bank accounts. the allowance does not afford them a half loaf of bread, he said.  teachers, who earn about a dollar a month, report a student textbook ratio of about   to  , and school attendance has dropped to about   percent in the past three months, the former president reported. the few students still attending classes are generally doing so in the hopes of being fed, he said.  \"meanwhile, top government officials and other privileged people can exchange zim money at a favorable rate that is several thousand times more than the official rate available to other citizens,\" carter said. \"they profit greatly from these monetary transactions and shop in special stores.\"  the nations four major hospitals have shut down, as roughly  ,  aids victims are dying each week. unchecked sewage and filthy water have compounded the cholera problem, and zimbabwes death rate from the disease is   times greater than rates in areas where treatment is available, carter said.  the former president said  ,  zimbabweans are fleeing the country each month, mostly to south africa and botswana. he estimated that   million people have fled the nation.  \"the middle class is departing, leaving behind the extremely poor and the small elite group around mugabe who are profiting from the economic disaster,\" he said.  comparing zimbabwe to somalia, a failed african state that has had no functional government since  , carter cast blame on african leaders who fail \"to confront robert mugabe and force him to accept the result of the march election and more recently to comply with negotiated political agreements to share governmental authority with morgan tsvangirai and the opposition party.\"  tsvangirai snared more votes than mugabe in marchs election but not a majority. tsvangirai dropped out of a subsequent runoff, citing widespread violence against mdc supporters.  carters call for african leaders to step up pressure on mugabe came a day before tsvangirai asked south africas mbeki to bow out as mediator between the mdc and zanu pf.  \"sadly, the negotiations have also been hampered by the attitude and position of the facilitator, mr. thabo mbeki. he does not appear to understand how desperate the problem in zimbabwe is, and the solutions he proposes are too small,\" tsvangirai said in his statement.  \"he is not serving to bring the parties together because he does not understand what needs to be done. in addition, his partisan support of zanu pf, to the detriment of genuine dialogue, has made it impossible for the mdc to continue negotiating under his facilitation.\"  asked for the zimbabwe governments reaction to the mdc asking mbeki to recuse himself, foreign minister mumbengegwi said, \"we have no right to tell them who to complain about. it is their decision in the mdc.\"  unless african leaders can find a way to mitigate the political impasse in zimbabwe, the united nations or the african union might need to enter the fray, because, carter said, \"the poisonous effects\" of the mugabe regime, including the cholera outbreak, are spilling into other african nations.  food, medicine and monetary donations should be sent immediately to humanitarian agencies such as care, world vision and save the children, carter said, advising that it is unwise to send cash directly to people in zimbabwe.  \"it is counterproductive to contribute money that can be confiscated

international monetary fund chief dominique strauss kahn was granted bail thursday after being indicted on charges related to the alleged assault of a maid in his new york hotel saturday.  \"it is  a great relief to the family to be able to have him with them,\" defense attorney bill taylor said to reporters outside the courtroom. he said his client would spend thursday night at the jail on rikers island before being released friday. the next court appearance, an arraignment, is slated for june  .  supreme court judge michael obus granted the bail on the condition that strauss kahn post    million in cash, that he also post a bond for    million, that he surrender his travel documents and that he submit to home detention.  the announcement came shortly after his indictment on seven criminal charges was announced. they are  two counts of criminal sexual act, two counts of sexual abuse, and one count each of attempt to commit rape, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching.  in the charge of criminal sexual act in the first degree, strauss kahn is accused of having \"engaged in oral sexual conduct with an individual ... by forcible compulsion,\" the indictment says.  \"under american law, these are extremely serious charges,\" manhattan district attorney cyrus vance told reporters outside the courtroom. \"the defendant was indicted on all the charges presented to the grand jury,\" he said.  strauss kahn resigned from his imf post on wednesday.  as he entered the courtroom for the bail hearing, he looked at his wife, seated in the front row, and smiled.  strauss kahn on monday had been denied bail, with the criminal court judge saying his attempt to leave the country after the alleged incident made him a flight risk. his lawyer argued thursday that strauss kahn had been scheduled to leave new york and fly to paris on saturday using a ticket he had bought on may  .  taylor said strauss kahn had called the sofitel hotel from john f. kennedy international airport to locate his cell phone, which he had left in the hotel, then called a second time as his plane was boarding to request that its delivery be hastened. instead, police at the airport took him into custody.  taylor noted that his client resigned his position as imf chief on wednesday, and had surrendered his passport and a united nations . issued travel document.  \"in our view, no bail is required,\" the lawyer said. \"he has one interest at this time and that is to clear his name.\"  taylor added that strauss kahn had agreed to live with his wife in an apartment in manhattan after his release.  prosecutor john mcconnell argued the high profile economist had no right to bail. \"while there is presumption of innocence, the proof is substantial and it is growing every day,\" he said, adding that the forensic evidence is consistent with an attack and the alleged victim has identified strauss kahn as her attacker.  mcconnell noted that france does not extradite its own nationals, and said strauss kahns departure on saturday from the hotel was in haste, suggesting \"something went on in that hotel room.\"  for his part, obus said he was solely concerned about ensuring strauss kahn returns to face charges. \"we do not  want his money,\" he said. \"we just want to make sure he comes back. he has resources to live comfortably in his own country.\"  as the hearing recessed, strauss kahn blew his wife a kiss.  meanwhile, strauss kahns alleged victim, a   year old guinean maid for the sofitel hotel, testified before the grand jury on wednesday, according to an attorney representing her.  \"if you have  had any experience with someone who has been traumatized by sexual assault, reliving it in your mind is hard enough,\" attorney jeffrey shapiro said on cnns \"american morning\" thursday. \"having to recount it, even to a therapist, is difficult, much less having to talk about it on the record in front of a grand jury. i mean, it is  extremely difficult, and nonetheless shes making it through this.\"  the case has set french political circles abuzz, as the international economist was widely considered the french socialist partys best hope to american eat president nicolas sarkozy in next years elections.  in a statement released thursday, sarkozy called strauss kahns resignation \"inevitable\" and called for an \"open and transparent selection process\" for strauss kahns replacement.  in a brief letter to the imf executive board late wednesday, strauss kahn proclaimed his innocence.  he said he was stepping down to \"protect this institution which i have served with honor and devotion, and especially    especially    i want to devote all my strength, all my time and all my energy to proving my innocence.\"  \"to all, i want to say that i deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me,\" he said.  in his letter, strauss kahn said he felt compelled to resign.  \"i think at this time first of my wife    whom i love more than anything    of my children, of my family, of my friends,\" he wrote.  \"i think also of my colleagues at the fund; together we have accomplished such great things over the last three years and more.\"  while the search begins to replace him, the first deputy managing director, john lipsky, will lead the fund, the imf said in a statement.  \"as acting managing director, john lipsky will provide able and experienced leadership to the fund at this critical time for the global economy,\" geithner said in a statement thursday. \"we want to see an open process that leads to a prompt succession for the funds new managing director.\"  in statements, south africa called for a candidate from a developing country to be named as strauss kahns

illegal and ordered the proper authorities to grant the couple a marriage license if they applied for one. on the eve of their december   wedding, however, another court filed an injunction, halting

  cnn     one of the most intriguing conversations i had at either the democratic or republican convention was with a white labor leader from ohio.  i ca not  remember his name, but he made it clear that he is going all around the rust belt state looking his white union brothers and sisters in the eye and essentially shaming them into supporting sen. barack obama for president.  no, hes not saying vote for the black man for president because hes black.  he said hes telling them that it is  shameful that as democrats, they agree with him on various political issues, but because of his skin color, they are refusing to cast ballots for him.  \"we have gone to our black brothers and sisters for years to support our [white] candidates, and it is  wrong for us to stand here and not support one of their own, even though we are  democrats,\" he barked.  there is nothing more in your face than to hear someone speak truthfully to the inherent racism that is at play in this election.  for all the talk about inclusion and the historic nature of this campaign, the true tribal feelings of so many people will come into play, whether we want to admit it or not.  we are seeing remarkable bias playing strongly in this election. exit polling data in the primaries showed some evidence of bias when it came to age, race and gender, but the great concern is whether people are as honest in talking to pollsters as they are in the voting booth.  because sen. john mccain is   and would be the oldest person to be sworn in as president, there is a lot of dialogue about how old this white guy is, and how wrong it is that hes running. age questions also have been raised about the   year old black guy from chicago and whether he is too young and inexperienced to lead.  while there is a lot of talk and excitement surrounding alaska gov. sarah palin being named as the first woman on a republican ticket, and what that may mean in terms of widespread female support coming the way of mccain palin, there are some voices who refuse to vote for a woman.  we have  also seen a number of prominent women    including washington post columnist sally quinn and radio talk show host dr. laura schlessinger    who have questioned whether the   year old white mother of five children should be vice president, considering she has five children, including a special needs child.  it is  wonderful to talk about the economy, immigration, the war in iraq, health care and education, but we ca not  be naã¯ve to the reality that when voters go into that voting booth, they will, as one person told me during an interview, \"vote with their tribe.\"  that was one of the arguments we heard during the democratic primaries when obama enjoyed overwhelming support from african americans    to the tune of   plus percent    while sen. hillary clinton had major female support, largely white, in the range of   to   percent.  so what do we do when it comes to our tendency to follow group identification    . stop dancing around the topic. when you watch tv and hear folks talk about wal mart moms or small, rural towns, they are talking about white americans. these catch phrases never include african americans or hispanics   . confront bias where it is. ask your friends, neighbors, co workers and church members who they are voting for. when they give you the \"i really ca not  put my finger on it\" line, then press them. hard. you know the real answer, so do not  beat around the bush. the best folks to challenge americans on their hang ups regarding age, race and gender are not  the aarp, naacp or now. it is  y o u. do not  give in to the \"thats the way i was raised\" mantra. when someone suggests that flags and faith show that a candidate is not  one of us, drill down.   . accept the fact that some people will not change. we all think that we have been gifted to the degree that our sane and logical arguments can get folks off their biased stumps. some people just wo not  give in. fine, move on. the goal is to rid our society of as much bias as possible. if someone is so hard headed, then you have to go on to the next person and try to change them.  it is  critical that we be as honest as possible about the impact of race, age and gender in campaigns. a lot of people love to toss around the rev. martin luther king jr.s quote that he hoped one day people would be judged by \"the content of their character.\" but it is  still a reality that skin tone, gender and our birth date means more than character to a lot of americans.  the opinions expressed in this

has changed now  the use of chemical weapons to kill people jolts us into probable action, but millions displaced, wounded and  ,  dead did not. why  because the banality of the policy shift rests on the assumptions that american cruise missiles can prevent further use of chemical weapons, provide a face saving measure for president barack obama who can argue that he acted after his \"red line\" had been crossed in syria, and neuter critics of obamas syria policy.  there is no absolute certainty as to whether al assad used chemical weapons, or rebel factions did. al assad has no credible motivation to use these weapons at this stage, and in this phase of the conflict. he is not losing.  if, as the russians claim, it was al qaeda affiliated al nusrah group or free syrian army elements that used weapons to bait america into the conflict, then american . firepower would be futile in establishing how a ragtag army and terrorists obtained chemical weapons. no amount of surgical strikes on government facilities will prevent non state actors from further use of these weapons.  what justifies intervening if syria uses chemical weapons   but if we believe that al assad used these weapons, and launch punitive attacks on syria, what exactly are we targeting  the secretive and globally isolated nature of the assad regime and therefore his chemical stockpiles means that we do not know where these are located.  we intervened in libya with greater confidence because gadhafis chemical weapons were mostly eliminated by an international inspection arrangement prior to the arab uprisings. by bombing syria now we increase the risk of al assad using chemical weapons on populations and cities that are not under government control, or to quell new rebellions. damaging his air force and known military installation would force him to consider his more extreme options for regime survival. syria is now a fight to the death for both sides.  u.s. led military strikes in syria will not change the tide of the war. that is not the mission, nor is it achievable by aerial blitzing. the syrian opposition is not a government in waiting. it is too fragmented ideologically, overwrought by al qaeda affiliates, deeply anti american, and dominated by suburban fighters with little control of major cities, mercenaries who are not committed to peaceful coexistence with syrias religious christians, nor its jewish neighbor.  syria after al assad will be worse. a new civil war will break out between opposition factions. by bombing syria today, we bear the burden of the

american peakable things often hit the headlines.  the young woman from kabul was falsely accused of burning pages in the holy quran.  what followed was the horror of mob rule, all captured on video while bystanders looked on.  soon after the incident, the images of her brutal slaying went viral on social media, noted afghanistans tolo news.  and this time, the outrage led afghans to the streets, with assistance from facebook and other social media.  these platforms have served both to disseminate the images of her savage beating and murder and as a means for convening those who are mobilizing and organizing to protest her killing.  last week, crowds chanted for days, calling for justice for farkhunda and \"death for her killers.\" and,tolo news reported, protests were held in different parts of the country, calling for the \"ultimate penalty to the perpetrators.\"  indeed, technology and connectedness have played a role in changing the old narratives in afghanistan, as farkhundas killing shows.  not only was her murder captured and shared online, but some of those men arrested for her killing were found to have confessed via social media posts. and now a countrys anguish is shared in those same online and virtual neighborhoods.  some afghan civil society leaders see the protests that have resulted as yet another sign of an evolving afghanistan    a nation whose recently elected leaders, now sharing a unity government, visited washington, d.c., in an effort to turn the page on the past.  \"when we are talking about this case, what is it showing us  first of all, when we are talking about womens rights, we see that we have succeeded; people will not tolerate what they tolerated a decade ago,\" said nargis nehan, founder and executive director of equality for peace and democracy, a non governmental organization created to promote \"a culture of peace, tolerance, transparency and accountability.\"  she was speaking last tuesday at a roundtable at georgetown universitys institute for women, peace and security, organized around the visit by afghan president ashraf ghani and chief executive abdullah abdullah.  \"if this was the afghanistan of a decade before and this would have happened, a small group of afghan women would have come to the streets to be seeking justice.  today we have men seeking justice.\"  nehan explained that the younger generation, a progressive generation, wants to have a peaceful afghanistan.  \"but at the same time, we have conservatives who have been power holders for many decades in afghanistan and they do not  want to see that. change always has a cost and unfortunately in this case we see that a very innocent girl like farkhunda has paid that.\"  nehan and other leaders from afghanistan could be seen checking facebook frequently for updates on what was happening on the streets of their capital. what they found was an online community sustaining the strong sense of injustice over farkhundas killing that prompted the afghan president to announce, even before he left for the united states, a fact finding commission to investigate her murder.  yet some afghan leaders worried that the brutality of this murder marked another troubling turning point in a country wrestling with a great many transitions    economic, security and political    all at once.  \"it never  before  happened to women at this level; this was really one of the shocking acts of violence publicly within the capital,\" said sima samar, head of the afghan human rights commission, at the georgetown panel.  \"it is not far from the palace, less than one kilometer.\"  \"my personal concern is that if we do not manage the case properly, it might be used against us and against womens rights in the country,\" samar added.  women have gained a great deal in the roughly   years since the taliban was ousted from power.  today,   million girls attend school. women serve in the countrys security forces    albeit in very small numbers. they sit in parliament and work as entrepreneurs, teachers and civil society advocates.  still, violence against women remains rampant and widespread. the practice of child marriage is outlawed but still common in some parts of the country.  and security and the economy are still major challenges, particularly in the more remote provinces of the country untouched by the modernization gripping the nations more urban centers.  indeed, samar and other human rights advocates and civil society leaders who have played a role in post taliban afghanistan say they are determined that farkhundas death will not be in vain. they say they will continue to fight to keep her case in the spotlight and to see justice served.  their commitment to seeking public justice for a public horror may well be one of the most powerful signals yet of an afghanistan that is indeed a very different nation than it was only a decade ago.   highlight  murder of   year old woman by mob

\"arabs got talent,\" one of the biggest televised talent contests in the region.  during her debut appearance, she looked so out of place that many thought she would  flop altogether.  \"it was nerve wracking,\" grout said, \"because i came on stage and i did not  understand.\"  the shows judges were questioning her in arabic, and grout had great difficulty following, making for some very awkward moments.  but then she started strumming her oud, a traditional arabic musical instrument, and the mood began to shift. she belted out a classic arabic song. thats when her life changed.  the american novice had chosen to cover an egyptian diva, legendary songstress umm kulthoum, so revered throughout the region that many arabic singers would be too intimidated to make such an attempt.  \"when i am  performing, i am  in a different element,\" grout said. \"so at that point, i was not  scared.\"  to everyones surprise, her rendition of the classic \"baeed annak  far from you \" was a huge hit.  \"when i finished, everyone was just shocked,\" explained grout. \"actually, when the judges were giving their comments after my performance, i did not  understand them, either.\"  she was not  the only one confused. fans of the show wondered how a young foreigner who barely spoke arabic could sing it so well.  \\'her voice just spoke to me\\'  it was just three years ago when grout, who would  spent most of her life studying classical music and opera, first encountered another grand dame of arabic music. she was studying at mcgill university in montreal at the time.  \"i came across an article online about the famous lebanese singer fairouz, and i was just really mesmerized by her singing,\" she remembers. \"it was like nothing i had heard before.\"  once she discovered umm kulthoum, her attention turned eastward.  \"well, her music is the best, and her voice just spoke to me,\" grout said admiringly. \"her music is just so deep, and it touches my soul.\"  she began studying arabic and learning how to play the oud. after college, she moved to morocco, where she learned local berber music and began performing in marrakeshs jemaa el fnaa square.  now, life is completely different. with her appearances on \"arabs got talent,\" grouts become very popular    but she has not  only made fans. critics have slammed her, asking why an american should be allowed to compete on a reality show for arabs.  her performance of syrian singer asmahans \"ya toyour  oh birds \" got her through to the finals. famous lebanese singer najwa karam, one of the shows judges and a supporter of grouts, faced criticism when she voted for the american over an arab group of contestants.  break with tradition  some have even suggested grout, the first non arab contestant to compete on the show, is not  even really american, latching on to her very distinct accent in an attempt to prove it.  she laughs off such claims.  \"ever since i was younger, i have  had a different way of speaking,\" she said. \"i remember when i was a kid growing up in boston, my parents had a vermont accent. i actually tried to pick up a boston accent at one point because i thought it was cool. and then i came home, and my parents were like, \\'why are you speaking like that \\' \"  grout says shes taking it all in her stride.  \"i like my accent. i like the fact that it is  unique, and i think it is  narrow minded to believe that just because you are  from a certain place, you have to speak a certain way. because people learn and people change and people travel, and things about them change all the time. why does that not include accents \"  grout has become a sensation by singing the most unexpected of songs.  it is  not just that she chose traditional songs, it is  also that she broke with tradition when doing so. at a time when more and more middle eastern musicians are borrowing western sounds and styles, this american decided to cross musical cultures and defy cultural expectations.  \"i am  really happy because this music is so special for me, but it does not  really get much acknowledgment in the west,\" she said. \"and i feel like i am  bringing a new

 but it was sheikh mansour who invested more than    million on players like aguero, yaya toure and carlos tevez, and helped the perennial underachievers beat neighbors manchester united to the title on goal difference.  the incredible images on sunday delivered the message on his behalf.  etihad airways, which carried a message of congratulations to city on its website on monday, reportedly paid more than    million for stadium naming rights and shirt sponsorship over   years, but the benefits are huge.  \"when you win national and international titles, the exposure to a very, very relevant

europe.  qatar sports investment  qsi  reportedly paid    million over five years to put the qatar foundation name on barcelonas shirt , but it is in france where the tiny natural gas rich nation is really making its presence felt.  qsi took over paris saint germain last summer, hoping not just to awake a sleeping giant of the french game but to create a new european powerhouse.  \"this is our strategy to bring psg on long term to be one of the biggest in the world,\" club president nasser al khelaifi told cnn in march.  to that end, psg brought brazilian leonardo on board as sporting director, paid a french record    million to sign javier pastore and hired carlo ancelotti as coach.  psg might miss out on the league title    trailing montpellier by three points with one game remaining    but the potentially exciting end to the season at least justifies al jazeeras investment in the ligue un domestic television rights at a reported ã¢â\\x80\\x9aâ¬  million a year until  .  al jazeera also has the international rights to the league, as well as most of the uefa champions league rights in france from  , and there are even suggestions that the broadcaster could make a bid for the uk rights for the english premier league.  it is all designed to establish qatar as a global sporting power, which the country hopes will be confirmed in   when it hosts the biggest single event sporting competition in the world.  the growing appeal of qatars domestic league has also been highlighted in recent times, with former spain and real madrid striker raul swapping german

sport.  much like prize fighters, defensive football players are trained to locate an opponents weakness and exploit it. if a guys arm is black and blue, nail it with the crown of your helmet. if a

sailed and discovered that the earth is round.\"  why did he \"hang up the sneakers \"  kai tsu has been training for over a year.  to prepare himself    \"because the mechanics are different,\"    he says, he has run barefoot on almost all the surfaces he will find along the road and during all his training sessions, he wore the backpack he will carry with him through the journey.  before he started training, he read about the tarahumara tribe, the history of human exploration and the minimalistic running trend, that according to mexican marathon runner german silva, could be \"a response in our society where theres so much of everything.\"  kai tsus barefoot training has been gradual and so far, the longest distance he has run is   kilometers  a little over   miles, , with four of

carrying only four pairs of sandals whose soles are designed specially for running and he plans to wear them when his feet become sensitive.  kai tsu has not  followed a specific diet since he will eat \"what i can find\" along the way.  he will try to consume chia seeds, a food source that \"contains    protein, a level markedly greater than other nutritional grains such as wheat, corn, rice, oats, barley, and amaranth,\" according to the european food safety authority.  his sponsors will also provide him with granola bars and vegetable supplements.  \"no one will follow me.\"  he picked this journey because he wants to be different from other adventurers such as jesper olsen, who has also run around the world. the difference  he has worn his running shoes and a support team escorted him along his treks.  unlike olsen, \"no one will follow me,\" kai tsu said.  his route has been based on the seasons so he does not  run during winter.  he knows where he will be every day, so in december he plans to be in central america, but he refrains from giving more dates and places because he does not  know what could happen along the way.  he is aware of the risks, from robberies to encounters with wild animals.  he is only carrying a first aid kit and an emergency button to be rescued by helicopter if needed, and although kai tsu tries not to think about it, he says that if

and two shootings    ripped mostly through shiite neighborhoods of baghdad, but also struck sunni communities in other towns. at least   people were wounded.  interactive  iraq   years on  the level of carnage has dropped considerably since the height of the sectarian violence in   and   that nearly tore iraq apart. but the continuing violence serves as a near daily reminder of the violence poses to the fragile political and economic gains in a post saddam hussein iraq.  it is  the second time in less than a week that the iraqi capital has endured major simultaneous attacks.  ten years on, the war left more than  ,  iraqis and more than  ,  american . and other coalition service members dead. the war cost hundreds of billions of dollars.  \"it remains entrenched and pervasive, with a clear beginning but no foreseeable end, and very much a part of the present in iraq,\" said iraq body count, a uk based group that tracks war deaths.  \"in major regions of the country armed violence continues to exact a remorseless toll on human life, young and old, male and female, across society.\"  in tuesdays violence, car bombs rocked baghdad neighborhoods long engulfed in conflict, like shulaa and kadhimiya. they struck mustansiriya university in eastern baghdad and the fortified international zone, also known as the green zone, where the citys international presence is concentrated. they hit cities north and south of the capital as well. authorities defused four car bombs in the southern city of basra.  attackers set off roadside bombs, another potent weapon for iraqi insurgents and a defining symbol of the war. one of those bombs rattled baghdads teeming shiite slum of sadr city.  the american . mission in iraq condemned the attacks in baghdad and in other provinces    such as anbar, kirkuk, babel, nineva, and diyala.  it was not immediately clear whether the attacks were related. no group immediately claimed responsibility for them.  ten years later, iraq is on pins and needles  change can be seen in the once war torn nation. a robust form of democracy has taken hold. sunnis, shiites, kurds and others often work together. there is more political, economic and social stability. coalition forces that ousted husseins government have departed.  however, recent attacks in shiite areas have spread fear among iraqis that sectarian warfare between sunnis and shiites may ravage the country again. attacks targeting the justice ministry last week left   dead and   wounded in strikes authorities suspect were carried out by al qaeda in iraq.  sunnis had more political clout during husseins reign. the shiites and the kurds, the other two main groups, were second class citizens. since hussein was toppled, the tables have turned. shiites    the largest religious group in the country    predominate in government. the kurdish semiautonomous region in the north, and the kurds themselves, have more clout.  today, sunnis feel they have  been politically marginalized. they demand that the shiite led government stop what they call negative treatment of iraqs sunni community.  sunnis largely boycotted iraqs   elections, leading to the emergence of a shiite led government. the move left the once ruling minority disaffected.  the deteriorating security situation prompted authorities to postpone provincial council elections scheduled for april in the predominantly sunni provinces of anbar and nineveh.  expert  the syrian conflict is hitting home in iraq  ramzy mardini, an expert on iraq, said the attacks were probably \"prescheduled for the anniversary.\" he also said the latest violence reflects the sunni shiite sectarian tensions raging next door in syria.  he believes such attacks illustrate the revival of the \"capability and confidence\" of al qaeda in iraq, buoyed by a syrian uprising \"spearheaded by sunni militancy.\"  it stands to reason that the attackers are targeting the government of iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki. the shiite dominated government is helping neighboring iran, the largest shiite nation in the world and a supporter of the alawite dominated syrian government.  \"al qaeda in iraq is becoming less exclusive to iraq. they are trying to channel energy and piggyback off the syrian revolution by aiming to merge iraq and syria into one theater of sectarian war,\" said mardini, adjunct fellow at the iraq institute for strategic studies in beirut, lebanon.  \"given that maliki is helping iran prop up the syrian regime, aqi is advertising their cause and looking to attract the support and resources of militant groups in syria.\"  mardini said sunni militants are baiting al maliki and shiites to retaliate.  \"they are  working overtime to plunge iraq back to sectarian war. but more important than the attacks will be how the shiites respond. restraint will be key, but harder to achieve should attacks against shiites continue. iraq has already entered the electoral season, where everyone on the political scene fuels the fear factor towards their respective sectarian corners.\"  it is likely that these attacks are not  going to taper off soon, he said.  \"what is  going on is a campaign, nothing isolated. the syrian revolution is a strategic force of instability and will continue to provide both rationale and support to sunnis trying to fight shiites anywhere in the region,\" he said. \"growing sunni discontent directed towards malikis government could be providing more cover for al qaeda fighters to operate than before.\"  the obama administration marks the

would  been imprisoned in egypt for more than a year were granted bail thursday, with a court telling them they can await retrial away from jail in a case that has outraged journalists and activists around the globe.  an egyptian court thursday ordered journalists mohamed fahmy and baher mohamed freed ahead of their retrial on charges that they supported the banned muslim brotherhood.  however, the men were still in custody thursday night, and with government offices closed on fridays for weekly prayers, their release might not come until saturday.  news of their pending release comes less than two weeks after al jazeera correspondent peter greste, a colleague who was convicted with them, was released and deported to his native australia.  bail for fahmy, an egyptian canadian citizen and former cnn producer, was set at  ,  egyptian pounds    ,  . mohamed, an egyptian citizen, is not required to pay but is barred from leaving the country ahead of the retrial.  fahmys family paid the bail thursday. the case is scheduled to resume on february  .  fahmy, who says he recently surrendered his egyptian citizenship under coercion to facilitate his ultimate release, addressed the court thursday, reasserting his innocence and brandishing an egyptian flag.  al jazeera applauded the two journalists\\' bail but called for their full exoneration.  \"bail is a small step in the right direction, and allows baher and mohamed to spend time with their families after   days apart,\" an al jazeera spokesman said. \"the focus, though, is still on the court reaching the correct verdict at the next hearing by dismissing this absurd case and releasing both these fine journalists unconditionally.\"  fahmy, mohamed and greste were arrested in egypt in december  , accused of supporting the muslim brotherhood and broadcasting footage    including video of clashes between police and protesters    that portrayed the regime falsely with the intention of bringing it down.  the journalists have said they were just doing their jobs, covering all sides of the stories in egypt.  all three were convicted last year on charges that included conspiring with the brotherhood, spreading false news and endangering national security, but they have maintained their innocence. greste and fahmy were sentenced to seven years in prison and mohamed to   years.  the three appealed their convictions, and in january their attorneys announced that egypts highest court had granted them a retrial.  amnesty international and other observers have long held that greste, fahmy and mohamed were pawns in a geopolitical dispute between egypt and qatar, the small middle eastern country that finances al jazeera.  qatar has long been perceived as a supporter of the muslim brotherhood.  at the time of their arrest, egypt was mired in political turmoil surrounding the coup of president mohamed morsy in his muslim brotherhood backed government. after morsys ouster, the military, which had staged the coup, declared the longstanding political party a terrorist organization.  the deportation of greste and thursdays bail for fahmy and baher mohamed follow a recent improvement in egyptian qatari relations.  in december, egyptian president abdel fattah el sisi met with a qatari envoy. days after that, qatar shut down an egypt based al jazeera affiliate, mubasher masr, which cairo accused of supporting the muslim brotherhood.  greste, fahmy and mohamed did not  work for that affiliate, but accusations against the channel were featured in their trial.  shortly after mubasher masr closed, the journalists\\' retrial was announced.  greste was released as part of a new egyptian law allowing the president to deport defendants. defense lawyers also asked egypt to deport fahmy.  in court thursday, fahmy said that an egyptian official told him he would have to renounce his egyptian citizenship first    something that fahmy said he had initially rejected.  \"then i got a call from a leading official in the country, and they told me  \\'mohamed, nationality is not a piece of paper, but it is in the heart. and you can visit egypt as a tourist and apply for the citizenship again.\\' \"  fahmy said he surrendered his citizenship reluctantly, adding that it was difficult for him in part because his family has long had proud ties to the military.  he again denied having any connection with the muslim brotherhood.  \"our reports were balanced, and had no fabrication or violation,\" he said.  his brother, adel fahmy, said fahmy was \"almost tormented\" by having to drop his egyptian citizenship to be granted a deportation decree from egypts president.  earlier this month, fahmys family appealed for his release in part on grounds of his health, saying in a statement published by an egyptian news outlet that he was ill with hepatitis c and had an injured shoulder.  fahmy injured his shoulder before his arrest and has complained about not getting proper treatment for the injury while in prison.  greste described in a january   letter how he and his colleagues were detained, saying that interior ministry officials burst into a hotel room that he and producer fahmy were using. officials rushed mohameds home, he said.  egypt is the sixth leading jailer of journalists in the world, according to a tally conducted in december by the nonpartisan committee to protect journalists.  the jailing and sentencing of the al jazeera journalists generated outrage from colleagues and activists around the world. a campaign led by al jazeera declared that \"journalism is not a crime.\"  many tweeted under the hashtag  freeajstaff and journalists, including christiane amanpour, cnns chief international correspondent, who held up a sign with the campaign on her show.  on thursday, international human rights lawyer amal clooney released a statement after egypts supreme court issued its reasons for overturning the original verdict and sentence in the case of fahmy.  \"i am encouraged by the supreme courts findings that the trial was unfair, and by todays ruling granting mr. fahmy bail. at the same time, there is no guarantee that a retrial will be carried out in compliance with international standards or result in the full acquittal on all charges that fahmy deserves. it may also take several months to complete,\" clooney said.  on february  , clooney gave cnn a statement regarding fahmy, who also used to work for cnn.  \"i have been in touch with the fahmy family and we are all delighted that peter greste has been released,\" it said. \"as mr. fahmys counsel we are doing all we can to ensure the same outcome for mr. fahmy, who has suffered the same injustice.\"  amal clooney to push  egypt to free al jazeera journalist  fahmys fiancee, arwa emara, told cnn in december that she had hoped, before fahmys arrest, that they would have a \"very simple life.\"  \"i was very happy when i first met mohamed,\" she said. \"i felt that hes the one. and after his arrest, i found myself doing things that i never expected that i am  able to do.\"  emara said they can now relax after the court has granted fahmy bail.  \"i am so exhausted and hes exhausted. and now we want to just go out ... enjoy life,\" emara said.  cnns ian lee and journalist sarah sirgany reported from cairo. cnns jason hanna reported and wrote

american college of sports medicine  acsm  urge cancer patients to be as physically active as possible both during and after their treatment.  \"the idea that you should be staying put and resting is ultimately doing more harm than good,\" says kathryn schmitz, ph.d., an epidemiologist at the university of pennsylvania school of medicine, in philadelphia. schmitz, who studies the role of physical activity in chronic diseases, presented the guidelines at the american society of clinical oncologys annual meeting last week.  health.com    minute workout, no gym required  the last thing people

minutes each day, says schmitz, and gradually increase their time by   percent to   percent each week until they can do   minutes at a stretch, five times per week.  there may be days when you feel nauseous, exhausted, or utterly despondent. but friends or family can help. \"a lot of it will be up to the caregivers, because they are the ones who will know how to motivate patients facing an

activity you enjoy, says alyson moadel, ph.d., the director of the psychosocial oncology program at the albert einstein cancer center, in the bronx, new york. \"it is not a one size fits all answer, since patients may be more responsive and adherent to different fitness programs,\" she says. \"it is  important to allow patients a choice and to tailor a fitness program to each patient.\"  fortunately the options are greater than ever before, as exercise programs for cancer patients have become increasingly popular nationwide. in   the lance armstrong foundation partnered with the ymca to provide physical activities designed specifically for survivors, and more and more hospitals are creating their own programs as well. cancer patients who are not  willing or able to travel to a

dozens of studies have demonstrated the benefits of staying active both during and after treatment.  regular exercise can help fight the weight gain that often comes with cancer treatment, including breast cancer. \"it is  about what the typical american could expect to gain over the course of a couple of years, but it is  happening all at once,\" says schmitz.  but exercise is also important for cancer patients whose treatment can cause them to lose weight. prostate cancer, cancers of the stomach and gut, and head and neck cancers can all lead to a significant decrease in muscle mass, as well as a loss of taste and an inability to process certain foods.  \"those patients really need to focus on resistance exercises,\" says schmitz. \"that will help them increase their muscle mass and gain that functional tissue that they need.\"  even though most patients wo not  be able to accomplish the same physical feats they were capable of before their diagnoses, adds schmitz, staying active

very funny; there was sincerity and genuine gratitude from many of the winners; despite weird digressions into arcane areas like sound recording, the program moved briskly enough.  but did the orchestra need to follow bigelows win of her long deserved best director prize, for \"the hurt locker,\" by playing the old helen reddy song \"i am woman\"   when zoe saldana and carey mulligan arrived on stage to present the best original song award, did they have to be intro ed with \"thank heaven for little girls\"   and in addition to being groped by baldwin, did bigelow have to be so

point  the producer of \"music by prudence\"    which had just won the oscar for best documentary short    barreled on stage, saying \"let the woman speak \" and commandeering the mike from her director, roger ross williams.  she provided a classic moment of oscar craziness and the one instance of spontaneity in an evening when all the big favorites won all the big prizes. burkett seemed boorish, sure. but that does not  necessarily make her wrong.  the academy of motion picture arts and sciences certainly faced a dilemma this year  vote for the future, or make up for the past.  years from now, it will probably look profoundly shortsighted that \"avatar,\" one of the biggest movies ever    and, more importantly, the one that indicates where movies are going    did not  win the top prize when hollywood had a chance to bestow it.  instead, the oscars gave their most coveted awards to a small indie film about an unpopular war and a director whose sex had never before been honored with a best director prize.  what helped make it all so complicated was not that theres been a long, long history of overlooked genius female directors that the oscars had to atone for.  the sin at stake was    and is    that women simply have never been given an equal chance to direct.  predictably, bigelow did not  have to be as good as the boys, she had to be better. and she was.  but earning your oscars and actually getting them are two different things. fortunately for bigelow, she had history on her side last night.  james cameron did not .  the billions being made by \"avatar\" will probably be some consolation, but neither he nor his movie are warm and fuzzy, which is what the academy voters like.  in fact, the big hearted, sentimental acceptance by best actor jeff bridges  \"crazy heart\" , and the rather elegant, funny remarks by best actress sandra bullock  \"the blind side\" , are exactly what we all want oscar night to be.  that, and a few good jokes, which is what

a strategy that was, at best, elusive.  for all the changing characters and categories on oscar watchers\\' betting pool ballots, there are certain things we bet on no matter what  one, that the show will be interminable; two, that it will last at least until midnight  et  no matter how they try to contain it; and, three, that there will be moments in the show itself that, although planned by seemingly sane individuals, will be inexplicable, if not grotesque.  last night did not disappoint. while someone like poor tivi magnusson got drowned out by the orchestra  after he and joachim back won best live action short for \"the new tenants\" , the shows producers thought it made perfect sense to devote relatively huge chunks of time to examining the niceties of animated short subjects or providing weary viewers the inevitable, american peakable interpretive dance number, this one devoted to the evenings musical scores.  more painful, at least to this viewers eyes, was an overlong salute to the late director john hughes, featuring a reunion of some of his more famous players, a few of whom    molly ringwald, for instance, and judd nelson    looked positively shell shocked.  the only surprises of the night were in the best foreign film category  the argentine \"el secreto de sus ojos,\" beat out the favored \"white ribbon,\" thus continuing the oscar tradition of giving the foreign film prize to something few have even seen  a foreign film oscar does not  do much good, one should remember, for a movie thats already opened and closed .  the other surprise was the rudeness with which costume designer sandy powell accepted her \"young victoria\" oscar.  \"i have  already got two of these,\" she said, before dissing her coworkers and, by extension, the academy in toto.  brusque dismissal is not a quality oscar tolerates very well and it is  not likely ms. powell will be back, unlike martin and baldwin, who were the funniest oscar hosts ever, proving theres power in

that president barack obamas foreign policy is \"feckless,\" \"mushy\" or \"too cautious\" and above all, that it lacks a clear overarching doctrine.  but obamas foreign policy is very clear insofar as it clearly reflects the unclear role of america at a time of national and global transition and is responsive to this moment in history. call it the \"transition doctrine.\"  whether one agrees with his decisions or not, it is  ridiculous to suggest the president is a weak leader. just ask osama bin laden. or consider that obama is bombing isis, pressing iraq to fix its broken government, working with nato to force russian president vladimir putin to back down and making real progress in curbing irans nuclear ambitions. and then there are the drone strikes, including one that killed the leader of the militant islamist group al shabaab in somalia. feckless  hardly.  the criticisms aimed at the president reveal more about those doing the criticizing, most of whom have never met a war they did not  like and have been so wrong so often on foreign policy it is  shocking they are  still deemed remotely credible at all  ahem, sens. john mccain and lindsey graham .  america tried \"cowboy adventurism\" as a foreign policy strategy. we did not  like it. we are  not trying it again. no matter how much dick cheney goads us. even though the actions of isis are atrocious, and public support for military action has increased, most americans are reluctant to rush into war and repeat the mistakes of the previous republican leadership.  for instance, even though fear of a terrorist attack has increased, according to a recent cnn/orc international poll, six in   american voters still oppose sending ground troops to fight isis. obama is echoing americas fatigue with the hawkish aggressions of the past by insisting he will not use ground troops.  yet to characterize obamas foreign policy strategy as merely a reaction to bush era truculence misses something else    that the very nature of the world, and americas role within it, is changing. of course, obamas foreign policy could use more clarity    because the world could use more clarity. whether bombing isis is the right strategy or not  and i think it is  not , republicans who support military action relentlessly dinged the president for not acting    and then dinged him for not acting sooner.  that sort of political point scoring overlooks the complexity of the situation. the entire region has been changed not only by the american war in iraq but also by the arab spring, which has altered the local geopolitics. amid the civil war in syria and the volatility of iraq, the brutal isis found a way to wreak havoc. no responsible military analysts believe the solution to isis is simple. bullheaded clarity in the face of such complexity would be naive.  in a   essay for foreign policy, samuel huntington described the early contours of global power that prevailed in the post cold war era. huntington wrote that international politics was a \"uni multipolar system with one superpower and several major powers\" and that the \"settlement of key international issues requires action by the single superpower but always with some combination of other major states; the single superpower can, however, veto action on key issues by combinations of other states.\"  that was then. today, the power of the united states has contracted, in part because our economic supremacy has been undermined by domestic challenges as well as by the rise of other global powers. there is less appetite for military spending abroad after george w. bushs expensive adventures.  obama is not the only one whos unambitious in flexing americas muscles or preferring to settle for singles and doubles in the game of global influence. his sentiment reflects the sentiment of american voters who are responding to the changing terrain of international politics. as our footprint of power around the globe is reduced, the practical expectations for stomping that foot    let alone singularly squashing any enemies with it    are also reduced.  a true multipolar world, where not just one country leads and dominates but many countries lead, has never quite existed in our modern time. it is  no wonder we ca not  yet realize our role within it.  we are  watching the president of the united states in real time leading our country and grappling with the future    it is  a process that, just like change itself, is neither clean nor tidy. it will take time to find our new formula for balancing force and restraint, diplomacy and aggression    between being a superpower versus not being the worlds police force.  those calling for the aggressive, big military, pro intervention no matter what policies not only ignore how that failed us in the past but also that the past is no longer our present. the \"transition doctrine\" is based on a clear eyed assessment of the world as it is today and the necessity for a new, responsible and effective american posture for the future.   highlight  sally kohn  critics say president obamas foreign policy is too cautious or lacks clarity   highlight  she

for the sats, taking my sister to soccer practice or cooking dinner.  she took on one new responsibility as well  driving another mother and her son to and from the stanford hospital, where the son was undergoing treatment for lymphoma. mom had never met them before last fall. yet, when she heard that they were new to the area, she gave them support and gained friendship.  this type of behavior is not out of the ordinary for my mom. when one of her colleagues in boston got diagnosed with breast cancer, mom organized a food drop off for the family. when she saw that a bright student was failing her class, she took him aside and bought him a textbook after learning he could not  afford them. this thanksgiving, she learned that a group of students could not go home for the break. mom invited them over for a home cooked dinner.  the day after that thanksgiving dinner, my mom was diagnosed for the second time with acute myelogenus leukemia  aml , a cancer of the blood    after eight years in remission.  now, she desperately needs a bone marrow transplant as soon as possible.  robin roberts found a match, but others likely wo not  be as lucky  due to certain genetic markers, her match will almost certainly come from someone from her birthplace    kerala, in southern india.  but south asian donors of indian, pakistani, bangladeshi, nepalese, bhutanese, maldivian or sri lankan descent are some of the least represented groups in the national marrow donor program. some campaigns recruiting south asians suggest that a south asian like my mom has a   in  ,  chance of finding a match, while the chance is   in   for caucasians.  when the news of my mothers illness became known, it seemed like everyone we had ever met    and even people we had not     were asking how they could help us. our friends in california set up an internet based food delivery system. our friends in boston flooded us with care packages.  once we learned that mom needed a transplant, her former students, friends, and colleagues    even those she did not know personally    started setting up bone marrow drives around the country.  on december  , we got a belated but incredible christmas present    moms doctors had found   potential bone marrow matches  the drives stopped, and we breathed a sigh of relief.  it did not  occur to us that none of the   potential matches would work out, or that people would back out of donating their bone marrow. so we were shocked when we got the heartbreaking news that half of the potential donors had refused to follow up. the other six did, but were ruled out upon further testing. our spirits were crushed.  why i donated my bone marrow  once more, those who care about mom stepped up to bring us hope. they launched a campaign site, nalinineedsyou.com, and a facebook site that has been seen by more than   million people  including more than  ,  in india  and received more than  ,  \"likes\" so far.  they also created a video  nalinineedsyou.com  that had  ,  views in its first three days on youtube and more than  ,  views through the stanford facebook page.  more than   drives targeting south asians were organized all over the world, held at colleges, temples, companies and festivals. thousands of people signed up to be on the national bone marrow registry.  although we have not yet found a match for my mom, at least six of these people have proved to be potential matches for other people desperately needing a transplant.  two weeks ago, we found out that mom had a match from india. we were ecstatic. but two days later, we found out that donor, too, was unwilling to donate.  although donation is generally safe and painless, the chief barriers are psychological and cultural. there is a diversity of opinions about biological donation across cultures, with some more traditional ones considering the practice taboo.  this might be one reason why india, the worlds second largest nation, has a bone marrow registry of  ,  people, according to datri, a nonprofit organization which drives and maintains registries worldwide. in comparison, there are  .  million donors on the united states\\' national marrow donor program. of those, only  , , or nearly   , are south asian. in fact, we learned that the potential match two weeks ago    a young man from india    had been talked out of donating by his parents.  why many would be bone marrow, blood stem cell donors back out  being a bone marrow donor is easy. screening is a simple swab of the cheek, and if you are found to be a match, donation is usually a simple outpatient procedure called peripheral blood stem cell collection. the donor receives injections for a few days before the donation to boost their own blood forming cells. these new cells are then collected through an iv and filtered from the rest of the blood.  my dream is to give mom the gift of life    in the form of a bone marrow donor. sadly, neither my sister nor i are matches. so i will  settle for challenging everyone who reads this to get on the bone marrow registry. if you are already a member, i salute you, but i challenge you to spread the word, so that my mom    or someone elses mom, dad, sibling, child or friend    can receive the gift of life. act now.  you can register at join.bethematch.org. if you would like to try to donate for mom, please submit the code \"nalini\" so that your swab kits can be expedited.   highlight  my mothers leukemia returned after eight years in remission   highlight  she desperately needs a bone marrow transplant as soon as

intergenerational war, with the older population cast as the \"greedy geezers\" eating so much of the pie that they leave only crumbs for the younger generation.  both republicans and democrats say that entitlements must be cut. the main losers of these cuts will be americans older than   who collect social security and cash in medicare checks. at the same time, both parties agree that we must spend more on the education of the young if we are to remain competitive in the world markets.  taking from the old is justified on the grounds that they take more out of social security than they paid in, while the young, who pay for social security, will find that the program has gone belly up by the time they retire. well heeled older people are said to be enjoying the good life while the young ca not  find jobs and are saddled with debt.  charles lane, writing in the washington post, makes the point with numbers. he cites a report from pew charitable trusts that says the median net worth of households headed by those   or older rose between   and   by more than   , . at the same time, that of households headed by those   or younger shrank by   , to less than   , . sixty percent of seniors find it easy to pay their bills and the same percentage expect their quality of their life to improve in the near future.  others use rather strong emotive terms. stephen marche, writing for esquire, refers to a \"bleeding up of the national wealth\" to the elderly from todays disenfranchised youth. the minnesota daily editorial board asserts that \"while no parent would honestly sell out their children, the american  has done just that.\"  dale brandy, writing in the american thinker, defines social security in terms of a class struggle between the \"young \\'have nots\\'...against the power, wealth, and influence of the older \\'haves.\\' \" health care expert karl stockton writes that the \"elderly receive the lions share  of health benefits  while breaking the backs of the young.\"  it makes the elderly sound like the    that    of the young should rail against.  these hostile statements ignore some elementary and some surprising facts. social security comes close to paying for itself, after some recent revisions. the way to curb medicare, which after all is merely a big reimbursement machine, is to cut the costs of health care rather than leave old people to chose between medications and their meals.  most important, it should surprise no one that people who completed the work years have earned and saved more than those who are just beginning to work or are early in their work career. and elementary fairness says that people who worked all their lives and saved a considerable share of their earnings rather than spent it all, should be allowed to live out their remaining years in reasonable comfort.  cnn money  senior victims lose average of   ,  to financial abuse  utterly ignored in all these tirades against the old, is the notion that the elderly get much more than young is based merely on public budgets and pays no mind to what happens to the large mountains of private dough.  the data leave not the slightest doubt that our seniors, far from spending it all on a big going out party during their retired years    which they surely are entitled to and could do    give trillions of dollars to the young in gifts. a study conducted by john j. havens and paul g. schervish of the center on wealth and philanthropy at boston college predicts that between   and  ,  a minimum of    trillion will pass from one generation to the next. they estimate that more than half of these funds will be transferred through bequests to heirs, about a quarter will go to estate taxes and fees, and the rest will be given to charities.  there seems to be no statistics about the billions grandparents spend, while still living, on their grandchilds first car, first house, college tuition, and such, but looking around me i find these amounts seem to vastly exceed what grandchildren grant their old folks.  there is always room for reallocating our public budgets, such as cutting the hundreds of billions we are spending in afghanistan and employing them in nation building at home, or stopping corporate welfare. we may even have to cap entitlements.  but the last thing we need is another heated confrontation and a new

the same should happen to factory farms here in the united states.  the crux of the argument was this   if we think dog should not  be eaten    like, ever, regardless of how clean the trade is and how quick the kill    then maybe we should think about the other animals we eat, and if and why we do not  feel the same way about them. is it because we spend so much time with dogs    looking into their

guilty verdicts were announced on the most serious charges against the former high school football stars friday.  luis ramirez died of blunt force injuries after a confrontation with a group of pennsylania teens.  gasps filled the courtroom and some had to be restrained by sheriffs deputies as they tried to rush the defense table after derrick donchak,  , and brandon piekarsky,  , were acquitted of aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and ethnic intimidation for the death of luis ramirez.  piekarsky was also found not guilty of third degree murder for the death of ramirez, who died of blunt force injuries after an encounter with the teens last summer.  however, the all white jury of six men and six women from schuylkill county jury found piekarsky and donchak guilty of simple assault.  the case drew national attention to the small town of shenandoah, pennsylvania, highlighting race relations and polarizing the community on who was to blame for the incident.  lawyers for the teens never denied that their clients were involved in a physical altercation with ramirez on a residential street the night of july  .  instead, they tried to cast ramirez as the aggressor, and suggested that the other teens involved in the tangle of punches and blows were to blame.  \"in my mind it was the lack of evidence to tie these kids to the serious charges that they brought,\" defense lawyer frederick fanelli said.  a cast of witnesses provided conflicting accounts regarding who initiated the encounter and who exactly did what, complicating prosecutors\\' efforts to assign blame.  \"if you ask most prosecutors who are dealing with multiple defendants, and in this particular case there were at least four, it is extraordinary difficult to clear the fog of a fight,\" trutv anchor ashleigh banfield said.  the   year old mexican immigrant had settled in shenandoah a year before his death with his wife, a lifelong resident of the faltering mining town, and their young children.  he was walking down a residential street with a friend when he encountered the group of teens, who had been drinking earlier in the evening. donchak was convicted of providing alcohol to the other teens who were involved in the confrontation, including a juvenile co defendant and another teen who pleaded guilty in federal court for his role in the fight.  prosecutors alleged that the teens baited the ramirez into a fight with racial epithets, provoking an exchange of punches and kicks that ended with ramirez convulsing in the street, foaming from the mouth. he died two days later in a hospital.  piekarsky was accused of delivering a fatal kick to ramirezs head after he was knocked to the ground.  as they poured out of courthouse, the teens\\' supporters shouted \"i was right from the start\" and \"i am  glad the jury listened\" at cameras that caught the late night verdict.  but gladys limon, a spokeswoman for the mexican american legal defense and education fund, said the jury had sent a troubling message.  \"the jurors here [are] sending the message that you can brutally beat a person, without regard to their life, and get away with it, continue with your life uninterrupted,\" she said.  \"in this case, the message is that a person who may not be popular in society based on their national origin or certain characteristic has less value in our society,\" she said.  the extent of ramirezs injuries, which had left his brain oozing from his skull, according to medical testimony, should have sufficed for a conviction other than simple assault, limon said.  \"the acts here were egregious in brutality and it is  just outrageous and very difficult to understand how any juror could have had reasonable doubt, especially as to the aggravated assault and the reckless enganderment charges,\" she said.  limon said her group intends to press the department of justice to file federal charges against the teens.  \"luis ramirezs family deserves vindication for his death,\" she said. \"this incident has not only disrupted luis ramirezs family, but the entire community.\"  cnns brian rokus contributed to this report.   highlight  teens acquitted of murder,

lawyers for the accused have argued in pre trial hearings that the woman was a prostitute, and the matter should be tried as a prostitution matter, rather than a rape case.  the trial has caused a sensation in china, focusing public attention once again on the excessive lifestyles of chinas rich and powerful and their families, who are widely seen as entitled and corrupt. it comes hot on the heels of the sensational trial of former communist party kingpin bo xilai, which offered a lurid snapshot of alleged corruption among chinas political aristocracy.  chinese social media users have

hospital that could perform such a surgery.  xie said that he went to local hospitals near the factory first, but he said they told him they \"did not have the skills to help.\" eventually he found a hospital about two hours away where doctors believed they could do it.  xie kept his hand in a plastic bag at first, then stored it in a cooler of ice. in total, it took about seven hours to get to a doctor who could help.  the doctor, dr. tang juyu, is a specialist in difficult tissue and wound repair cases. before xie went into the operation, tang told him he was optimistic and predicted he

vessels were attached. his leg felt no different, he said, but was \"heavier than usual.\"  after about a month his arm was better healed, and he had another surgery where his hand was reattached.  tang says this second stage of the operation is actually more challenging, but everything went smoothly.  xie has recovered without complications and has been discharged. he is currently resting at home.  he said he can twist his wrist to a certain degree, but does not  have full movement with his fingers, at least not yet. doctors told him a full recovery for the nerves in his hand should take

situation but declined to comment further.  \"trading in kraft was affected by a broker error that impacted multiple stock exchanges,\" nasdaq said. \"nasdaqs systems performed normally and the industrys process for handling these issues worked as intended.\" the exchange declined to name the company where the trading error originated.  eric hunsader, chief executive of nanex, a market data

failing to send a higher ranking representative of the united states to the paris unity march on sunday.  \"i think it is  fair to say that we should have sent someone with a higher profile to be there,\" white house press secretary josh earnest said monday afternoon.  he said obama himself would have liked to attend the march \"had the circumstances been a little different.\" but planning began friday night,   hours before the event began, and there was not  enough time for the \"onerous and significant\" security work that needed to take place ahead of a presidential visit, earnest said. he said obamas presence also would have meant extra restrictions on the people who were there.  \"that said, there is no doubt that the american people and this administration stand foursquare behind our allies in france as they face down this threat,\" he said. \"and that was evident throughout last week.\"  more than   world leaders, including the british, german and israeli heads of state and russias foreign minister, joined at least  .  million people on the paris streets sunday for a unity march that became frances biggest ever public demonstration.  but obama and his administrations top hands were nowhere to be found    an absence that triggered complaints that he missed a key leadership opportunity.  the united states appeared to have options to send to the march  obama spent sunday at the white house with no public events on his schedule. vice president joe biden was at home in delaware for the weekend, also with a blank public schedule. outgoing attorney general eric holder was already in paris for security meetings    and even recorded interviews with several american . sunday morning programs    but he did not  attend the march.  a secret service official said the agency was not asked to draw up security plans for a potential presidential trip to paris in advance of sundays march.  \"we were not  asked or notified about a trip,\" the official said. but the agency had secret service agents on the ground in paris, per its standard operating procedure.  \"it would have been a challenging advance ... based on what we know,\" secret service spokesman brian leary said. but leary did not say that such an advance would have been impossible.  during the white house briefing, earnest suggested security challenges were a factor in not having the president travel to paris. but earnest acknowledged the secret service could have pulled it off. an agency official noted previous \"last minute\" presidential trips have happened during the obama presidency, including a hurried visit to south africa in december   for the memorial service for nelson mandela.  the white house noted that it was represented in paris on sunday    and has offered support to france in recent days.  u.s. ambassador to france jane hartley was in the march, as was assistant secretary of state victoria nuland. at a security summit, holder was joined in those security meetings by deputy homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas.  obama personally visited the french embassy in washington last week to offer his support.  secretary of state john kerry, meanwhile, will visit paris on friday.  kerry skipped mondays march because he was in india on monday for a long planned event there with new prime minister narendra modi    a key relationship as the united states tries to improve long strained trade ties with the country.  kerry brushed the criticism off as \"quibbling,\" saying he will  visit paris on his way back to the united states to make \"crystal clear how passionately we feel\" about the attacks and response.  \"the american . has been deeply engaged with the people of france since this incident occurred,\" kerry told reporters, adding that the united states has offered intelligence and law enforcement help.  \"this is sort of quibbling a little bit in the sense that our assistant secretary of state victoria nuland was there and marched, our ambassador was there and marched, many people from the embassy were there and marched.\"  frances ambassador to the united states, gerard araud, sought to show there are no hard feelings, tweeting on monday  \"i am extremely grateful for the overwhelming support france has received from everybody here, from the president to the ordinary american.\"  the white houses push back comes as obama takes heat    particularly from republicans considering   presidential bids    for his absence.  rick perry tweeted that obama \"should have stood with france in person to defend western values and show support for victims.\"  sen. ted cruz  r texas  wrote for time  \"our president should have been there, because we must never hesitate to stand with our allies.\"  and sen. marco rubio  r fla.  said monday that \"it was a mistake not to send someone.\"  rubio said on cbs\\' \"this morning\" that he understands that the presidents security detail can be problem in mass gatherings like the rally, but suggested holder or kerry should have gone in his place.  \"i think in hindsight, i would hope, that they would do it differently,\" rubio said.  british prime minister david cameron,  german chancellor angela merkel, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov were among those who attended, along with religious leaders.  fareed zakaria, host of cnns \"global public square,\" called the absence of top american . officials a mistake.  france is the united states\\' \"deepest ideological ally,\" he said, and it would have been a meaningful image to have a senior administration member, or the president, standing shoulder to shoulder with other leaders.  zakaria noted that security concerns did not  dissuade netanyahu or abbas or other leaders from showing up. but obamas absence did show that the struggle against radical islam is \"not all about america,\" zakaria said.  \"many people have tended to think that islamic terrorism would not  exist without america,\" zakaria said. \"this is really a struggle between the civilized world and a band of extremists. even if you take the american . out of it ... the civilized world is up in arms.\"  and jake tapper, host of cnns \"the lead,\" said american leaders were conspicuously absent from historic paris rally, perhaps the most important public demonstrations in europe in the last generation.  tapper not only called out the president and his administration, but also prospective   hopefuls from both parties, for missing the opportunity to share in the global moment.  obama spoke about the paris attacks on friday, saying he wants the people of france to know the united states \"stands with you today, stands with you tomorrow.\"  the white house also announced sunday that it will host a february   summit aimed at countering violent extremism.  earnest said that event will \"highlight domestic and international efforts to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from radicalizing, recruiting or inspiring individuals or groups in the united states and abroad to commit acts of violence, efforts made even more imperative in light of recent, tragic attacks in ottawa, sydney and paris.\"  he said the summit will include presentations, panel discussions and small group meetings, focused

court thursday, may admitted to tipping off mine managers that inspectors from the federal mine safety and health administration were on their way, allowing them to clean up hazards like poor airflow and piles of loose coal that would have led to citations and fines. he also admitted to falsifying safety records and telling miners to rewire a device that monitored flammable methane gas levels, allowing mine equipment to run illegally, prosecutors said.  \"people who run coal mines have a fundamental obligation to be honest with mine regulators,\" goodwin said. \"when mine operators resort

designed to keep them safe.\"  may faces an august   sentencing hearing in beckley, west virginia.  the upper big branch explosion was the worst american . mine disaster since  , when   men died in a fire at the sunshine mine in kellogg, idaho. in a december report, msha found a methane ignition that set off flammable coal dust was the immediate cause of the   explosion, but it also blamed the \"unlawful policies and practices\" of massey energy, which it said \"promoted and enforced a workplace culture that valued production over safety.\"  massey kept two sets of books to mislead federal inspectors and its own workers about hazards in the mine, and had twice as many accidents as it reported to regulators, the report concluded. the company failed to conduct adequate inspections, intimidated workers to prevent them from reporting violations and tipped off crews to surprise inspections, msha found.  alpha natural resources bought massey in   and has agreed to a    million settlement to avoid prosecution. the deal includes payments of   .  million to each family that lost a member in the upper big branch mine.  an earlier state investigation found the mine lacked adequate ventilation; water sprays on equipment were not properly maintained and failed to function as they should have; and the mining company did not  meet federal and state safety standards for the application of rock dust, a crucial tool in keeping highly volatile coal dust from exploding.  massey energy    whose former ceo, don blankenship, was an outspoken critic of federal regulators    disputed that report, saying the blast probably occurred when natural gas flooded into the mine. msha said that investigators considered that explanation but that it did not  fit the facts.

official sorry for racist email  \"the republican party of orange county condemns racism in any form, and this censure is consistent with that position,\" the group said in a statement.  a phone call thursday night to davenport, for her comment on the censure, was not immediately returned.  last month, she found herself in a storm of controversy after forwarding an email she says she received from a friend. it contained a doctored photo styled like a family portrait, showing two adult chimpanzees and a baby. the younger chimpanzee had a photo of obamas face superimposed over the animals face.  the caption that ran with the photo read, \"now you know why no birth certificate.\"  davenport, who is a tea party activist and an elected member of the central committee of the republican party of orange county, said she felt the email was a joke, cnn affiliate ktla reported. it referred to debate over whether or not obama was born in the united states.  soon after it came out, the countys gop chairman, scott baugh, called for davenports resignation in a twitter message posted on the groups website. californias democratic party has also demanded that davenport step down.  in an apology that included two bible passages, davenport initially said she would not repeat her error.  \"i am an imperfect christian lady who tries her best to live a christ like honoring life,\" the statement said. \"i would never do anything to intentionally harm or berate others regardless of ethnicity. so i ask for your forgiveness, for i am truly sorry.\"  later, on april  , she told reporters she wanted to \"humbly apologize and ask for your forgiveness for my unwise behavior.\" davenport admitted that, \"unintentionally, i have offended many\"    though she insisted that she was not racist.  she has refused to resign, citing what she called an overwhelming number of appeals she has gotten from her constituency asking her not to do so. she represents the states  nd assembly district for the republican central committee.  in its statement thursday, the orange county republican committee called out davenport and said that she was aware the email \"could be viewed as offensive.\"  \"then instead of owning up to her mistake and putting an end to the story, mrs. davenport immediately sought to blame others and downplay the matter as a joke,\" the gop committee said, calling the first apology she would  made in a statement \"not contrite\" and \"conditional.\"  the committee viewed her second apology as more sincere, while noting that the \"three day delay in issuing that apology resulted in a torrential barrage of united nations ecessary media attention.\"  \"finally, the committee found that much of the good that was accomplished by mrs. davenports second apology was undone by going on a media tour that continued to blame others for her actions,\" the statement said.  during her press conference, davenport referred to the email as \"political satire\"    insisting she had no intention of doing anything that would be racist.  obama and his staff produced copies of his birth certificate indicating he was born in hawaii when he was running for president in  . on april  , after months of further speculation amid claims he was born in another country, he released the long form of the same certificate in hopes of finally quelling the controversy.  \"we do not have

america, he has learnt, drawing attention to your point of view does not necessarily imply jailing or inflicting bodily harm to your dissenters but may be as simple as submitting an op ed to the new york times. that is exactly what happened on september  , when the renowned peacemaker of chechnya advised barack obama to \"stop the language of force and return to the path of civilized diplomatic and political settlement\" on the matter of syria.  read more  putin  , obama     this was a sweet topic of conversation and an interesting response to obamas address to the nation the night before, but the russian president also criticized his counterpart for having mentioned \"american exceptionalism\" as a justification for using force or imposing its views on other sovereign countries. there, putin may have a point.  the american exception may be obvious to americans, but it has always been a subject of conjecture for everyone else. simple sense of superiority  candid idealism  cynical expression of self interest  in the eyes of foreigners, the concept varied according to who in america mentioned it, when it was used, and what country, rich or poor, had to deal with it. adding to the complication, the americans may disagree on its meaning.  rush limbaugh, the conservative radio celebrity, immediately said that obama had no idea what the american exceptionalism is. nevertheless, the president, on september  , used its most classical wilsonian definition, after describing the fate of gassed syrian children. he meant that america has a heart of gold, and more than any other nation, the cruise missiles to prove it. moral ambitions or pretentions, coupled with overwhelming force. a recipe for success, or, to say the least, disappointments.  as a european child, i was raised in the epic of the gis of d day crushing nazis, but soon, in  , i noticed new kids had arrived in my school in a working class suburb of paris. they came from chile, sometimes with only one parent because the other one had been shot dead or was being tortured in santiago. their former president, i understood, was not to the liking of the american government of the times.  as an adult, and a journalist, i could see the same post vietnam superpower set sail to somalia at the request of public opinion and pack its bag at the first casualties, abandon the rwandan tutsis   much like every western power  before making good on its promises against the serbs. all this to say that american exceptionalism was only rarely exceptional. the myth even took a fatal beating in iraq under george w. bush, and worse, was shamed by the nonsense of guantanamo and the sordid exactions of the baghram prison in afghanistan.  barack obama on september   had at least the courage to try to invoke the mythology. but the damage is done. an example  human rights organizations, mostly born in the united states in the  s, focused back then their action on prodding the american government to use its power and influence to reform rogue regimes abroad. this is simply impossible today because of the terrible deficit of credibility of washington in this matter. now, these organizations have to build up their power by themselves, and multiply foreign bureaus at great cost to obtain results and try to save lives.  the reactions to putins op ed proves that he hit a nerve in the united states. the american exceptionalism, understood as a sense of entitlement, superiority, uniqueness and sometimes immunity to any positive foreign influence is also shaken in the homeland. for long, i had been unable to discuss the tax system, the lack of universal health care, the humongous price of cable or the technology of washing machines without receiving a dreadful glare from american friends, followed by a fatalist and severe \"thats the way we do things here.\"  it is easier now. good news, the american way seems to follow some of the ways of the world, much as the sacred and mythical \"french model\" meets reality. america, the new free society deemed exceptional by tocqueville, was a pioneer in countless domains, like technology, education and justice, before suffocating and declining in its superb and often trivial isolation.  its values  the country that sent humans to the moon seems now, for the first time in decades, willing to temper ideologies to repair its bridges and roads. the mecca of medical innovation tries to tackle its dismal public health problems. the birthplace of juvenile justice ended up locking its kids for life without parole. but the

spilled out over the web after the death of steve jobs. but they should.  and then some.  \"when steve jobs died last week, there was a huge outcry, and that was very moving and justified. but dennis had a bigger effect, and the public does not  even know who he is,\" says rob pike, the programming legend and current googler who spent   years working across the hall from ritchie at the famed bell labs.  on wednesday evening, with a post to google+, pike announced that ritchie had died at his home in new jersey over the weekend after a long illness, and though the response from hardcore techies was immense, the collective eulogy from the web at large does not  quite do justice to ritchies sweeping influence on the modern world.  dennis ritchie is the father of the c programming language, and with fellow bell labs researcher ken thompson, he used c to build unix, the operating system that so much of the world is built on    including the apple empire overseen by steve jobs.  cnns geekout blog  without ritchie, you would not  be reading this  \"pretty much everything on the web uses those two things  c and unix,\" pike tells wired. \"the browsers are written in c. the unix kernel ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x80\\x9d that pretty much the entire internet runs on    is written in c. web servers are written in c, and if they are  not, they are  written in java or c++, which are c derivatives, or python or ruby, which are implemented in c. and all of the network hardware running these programs i can almost guarantee were written in c.  \"it is  really hard to overstate how much of the modern information economy is built on the work dennis did.\"  even windows was once written in c, he adds, and unix underpins both mac os x, apples desktop operating system, and ios, which runs the iphone and the ipad. \"jobs was the king of the visible, and ritchie is the king of what is largely invisible,\" says martin rinard, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at mit and a member of the computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory.  \"jobs\\' genius is that he builds these products that people really like to use because he has taste and can build things that people really find compelling. ritchie built things that technologists were able to use to build core infrastructure that people do not  necessarily see much anymore, but they use everyday.\"  from b to c  dennis ritchie built c because he and ken thompson needed a better way to build unix. the original unix kernel was written in assembly language, but they soon decided they needed a \"higher level\" language, something that would give them more control over all the data that spanned the os. around  , they tried building a second version with fortran, but this did not  quite cut it, and ritchie proposed a new language based on a thompson creation known as b.  depending on which legend you believe, b was named either for thompsons wife bonnie or bcpl, a language developed at cambridge in the mid  s. whatever the case, b begat c.  b was an interpreted language    meaning it was executed by an intermediate piece of software running atop a cpu    but c was a compiled language. it was translated into machine code, and then directly executed on the cpu. but in those days, c was considered a high level language. it would give ritchie and thompson the flexibility they needed, but at the same time, it would be fast.  that first version of the language was not  all that different from c as we know it today    though it was a tad simpler. it offered full data structures and \"types\" for defining variables, and this is what richie and thompson used to build their new unix kernel. \"they built c to write a program,\" says pike, who would join bell labs   years later. \"and the program they wanted to write was the unix kernel.\"  ritchies running joke was that c had \"the power of assembly language and the convenience of ... assembly language.\" in other words, he acknowledged that c was a less than gorgeous creation that still ran very close to the hardware. today, it is  considered a low level language, not high. but ritchies joke did not  quite do justice to the new language. in offering true data structures, it operated at a level that was just high enough.  \"when you are  writing a large program    and thats what unix was    you have to manage the interactions between all sorts of different components  all the users, the file system, the disks, the program execution, and in order to manage that effectively, you need to have a good representation of the information you are  working with. thats what we call data structures,\" pike says.  \"to write a kernel without a data structure and have it be as consist and graceful as unix would have been a much, much harder challenge. they needed a way to group all that data together, and they did not  have that with fortran.\"  at the time, it was an unusual way to write an operating system, and this is what allowed ritchie and thompson to eventually imagine porting the os to other platforms, which they did in the late  s. \"that opened the floodgates for unix running everywhere,\" pike says. \"it was all made possible by c.\"  apple, microsoft and beyond  at the same time, c forged its own way in the world, moving from bell labs to the worlds universities and to microsoft, the breakout software company of the  s. \"the development of the c programming language was a huge step forward and was the right middle ground ... c struck exactly the right balance, to let you write at a high level and be much more productive, but when you needed to, you could control exactly what happened,\" says bill dally, chief scientist of nvidia and bell professor of engineering at stanford. \"[it] set the tone for the way that programming was done for several decades.\"  as pike points out, the data structures that richie built into c eventually gave rise to the object oriented paradigm used by modern languages such as c++ and java.  the revolution began in  , when ritchie published his research paper on the language, and five years later, he and colleague brian kernighan released the definitive c book  the c programming language. kernighan had written the early tutorials for the language, and at some point, he \"twisted dennis\\' arm\" into writing a book with him.  pike read the book while still an undergraduate at the university of toronto, picking it up one afternoon while heading home for a sick day. \"that reference manual is a model of clarity and readability compared to latter manuals. it is justifiably a classic,\" he says. \"i read it while sick in bed, and it made me forget that i was sick.\"  like many university students, pike had already started using the language. it had spread across college campuses because bell labs started giving away the unix source code. among so many other things, the operating system gave rise to the modern open source movement. pike is not  overstating it when says the influence of ritchies work ca not  be overstated, and though ritchie received the turing award in   and the national medal of technology in  , he still has not  gotten his due.  as kernighan and pike describe him, ritchie was an unusually private person. \"i worked across the hall from him for more than   years, and yet i feel like a do not  knew him all that well,\" pike says. but this does not  quite explain his low profile. steve jobs was a private person, but his insistence on privacy only fueled the cult of personality that surrounded him.  ritchie lived in a very different time and worked in a very different environment than someone like jobs. it only makes sense that he would not  get his due. but those who matter understand the mark he left. \"theres that line from newton about standing on the shoulders of giants,\" says kernighan. \"we are  all standing on dennis\\' shoulders.\"  additional

rob portman of ohio announced he is now a supporter of the freedom to marry. what changed his thinking after voting against gay rights in the past  finding out that his son    a yale sophomore    was gay, and realizing that sexual orientation is not a choice but an innate quality.  \"i have come to believe that if two people are prepared to make a lifetime commitment to love and care for each other in good times and in bad, the government should not  deny them the opportunity to get married,\" he said.  portmans change of heart is significant because he is the highest ranking elected republican in america, who is currently in office, to endorse same sex marriage. but he joins a growing number of republicans who have already done just that.  indeed, portman is just the latest addition to an increasingly common occurrence in republican politics at the county, city and state level.  to date   elected republican state legislators have voted to legalize same sex marriage in   states  connecticut, illinois, maine, massachusetts, minnesota, maryland, new hampshire, new york, new jersey, rhode island, vermont, washington and wyoming. only nine states and the district of columbia allow same sex marriage, but gop elected officials have voted for marriage when it came up for vote in their legislative chambers in illinois, wyoming and rhode island, though the law has not  yet passed in those states.  sutter  gay people live in   americas  the conservative argument for marriage includes a recognition of the traditional value of marriage as a stabilizing force in society. another, economic argument holds that married individuals tend to accumulate more wealth than single individuals  putting them at lesser risk of state dependency , not to mention that marriage produces more government revenue through taxation. californias ban on same sex marriage cost san francisco   .  million per year in receipts, according to ted egan, chief economist in the san francisco controllers office.  the elected officials who support same sex marriage are surfing a rapidly rising tide among republican rank and file. a new abc/washington post poll shows that    of republicans younger than   support same sex marriage.  there are good reasons for this. conservative faith traditions argue rightly for strict religious protections in the law so that churches, synagogues and mosques are not  forced to perform ceremonies inconsistent with their religious teachings. but americans\\' diverse religious backgrounds have the golden rule in common, and conservatives in favor of civil marriage argue that it is consistent with faith traditions for republican policies to treat others, including gays and lesbians, with the same level of respect and fairness under the law that we wish for ourselves.  constitutional conservatives point to the role of the courts in protecting fundamental rights. they argue that marriage is such a right, enshrined in the constitution, and one that cannot be subject to the whims or tyranny of a majority of voters, even if they were to wish to limit the freedoms of gay and lesbians. more and more republicans are recognizing and respecting the essential dignity of individuals who are gay and deserve the full rights of citizenship, just like their straight brothers and sisters.  opinion  gay marriage, then group marriage   these are the messages that last november brought republicans and independents to the voting booth in maryland, maine and washington, where same sex marriage was approved for the first time by voters, not courts or legislatures. minnesotans, who rejected a constitutional ban on same sex marriage in november, are now poised to legalize marriage this legislative season, with the historic distinction of bipartisan support  republican state sen. branden petersen is a co sponsor of the bill.  the timing of portmans announcement is no accident. in less than a week, theodore olson, george w. bushs solicitor general and a charter member of the conservative federalist society, will argue before the united states supreme court that same sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. accompanying him is an amicus brief, signed by   prominent republicans,  i was also a co signer  making the conservative case for same sex marriage, an effort organized by former republican national committee chair ken mehlman.  it is  hard to imagine that the justices are not  taking notes on our countrys rapid transformation on this issue.  the final safe haven within the conservative movement for anti gay bigotry    the american conservative unions cpac convention, held last week in maryland    received more than a few hearty smackdowns. the editors of national review, the conservative movements founding publication, chided cpacs exclusion of gay conservatives, which was followed by a convention panel hosted by the competitive enterprise institute entitled, \"a rainbow on the right  growing the coalition, bringing tolerance out of the closet\"  full disclosure  i spoke on that panel .  listen  voices from the southern closet  finally, the conservative intellectual pillar charles murray took the cpac stage to argue that the conservative movement must accept same sex marriage if it wishes to win elections in the future.  the data are inescapable     of all republicans believe in either same sex marriage or another form of legal recognition of same sex relationships and    of republicans support employment nondiscrimination protections for gays and lesbians. at this point, the support for same sex marriage from former vice president cheney, former first lady laura bush and former secretary of state colin powell is icing on the cake. in the words of portman, this is less a partisan issue than a generational issue.  portman embodies the formula for gop modernization  a conservatism that unapologetically applies the principle of individual freedom consistently to both fiscal and social policy. the senator has breathed new life into a national party grasping for traction with young americans.  to regain relevance, the beltways republican establishment organizations owe a debt of gratitude to leaders like portman, peterson and new york rep. richard hanna for representing their familys and friends\\' right to equal freedom and

litany of stories about hollywood celebrities espousing its benefits, as well as the dangers of this relatively american tudied substance that triggers hallucinations.  on this sundays episode of \"this is life,\" lisa ling goes inside an ayahuasca ceremony in peru and talks to the men and women who are drinking this potent brew in hopes that it will alleviate their mental and emotional traumas.  here are six things to know about ayahuasca, which some call a drug and others call a medicine   war vets are seeking it for ptsd  former marine lance cpl. ryan lecompte organizes trips to peru for war veterans, like himself, who are seeking ayahuasca as a possible treatment for ptsd and other emotional and mental trauma suffered after multiple combat deployments.  he says hes aware of the risks, as theres very little known about ayahuascas effect on the body, but he says \"it is  a calculated risk.\"  \"ayahuasca is a way to give relief to those who are suffering,\" says lecompte, who says many veterans are not satisfied with the ptsd treatment they receive when they return from combat.  \"it is  just, \\'heres a pill, heres a band aid.\\' the ayahuasca medicine is a way to, instead of sweeping your dirt under the rug, you know, these medicines force you to take the rug outside and beat it with a stick until it is  clean,\" lecompte explains. \"and thats how i prefer to clean my house.\"  libby, an airman  st class, is one of the veterans who accompanied lecompte to peru to try ayahuasca for her ptsd diagnosis, which includes sexual trauma while on active duty. she says antidepressants made her more suicidal.  \"i would like to wish not to die all the time,\" she said, when asked why she was seeking ayahuasca. \"i want that to go away\"  it is  endorsed by some hollywood celebrities  as more ayahuasca centers pop up in the united states, not surprisingly, celebrities including sting and lindsay lohan have spoken publicly about their experiences with the substance    albeit illegal outside of religious purposes in the united states.  lohan, who has struggled with addiction, called her ayahuasca experience \"eye opening\" and \"intense.\" \"i saw my whole life in front of me, and i had to let go of past things that i was trying to hold on to that were dark in my life,\" she said on her own reality series \"linsday.\"  sting said he and his wife, trudie styler, traveled to a church in the amazon where they tried ayahuasca, which the british singer said made him feel like he was \"wired to the entire cosmos.\"  it is  not a cure  those of have tried ayahuasca say that any benefits    like with other drugs or medicine    must be combined with therapy.  \"if you think you are  just going to take \\'joy juice\\' ... you are  nuts,\" explained author and ayahuasca expert peter gorman, who settled in iquitos, peru, during the first wave of ayahuasca tourism in the  s.  \"the five years of work to get rid of [mental trauma] is still gonna be on you.\"  gorman, author of \"ayahuasca in my blood,\" explains that ayahuasca can help \"dislodge that negative energy\" and show people what their life could be like without the negativity.  \"[then] you can go back home and work on getting rid of it.\"  and it used to be taken by only the shaman  gorman says ayahuasca traditions in the amazon have changed since western tourists began seeking its benefits.  \"traditionally, the shaman drinks [ayahuasca], he accesses other realms of reality to find out where the dissonance is, that if the shaman corrects, will eliminate the [symptoms]    could be physical, could be emotional, could be bad luck,\" gorman explains. \"[then] we americans come, and we said we insist on drinking the damn stuff    we want our lives changed and we want that experience, so that certainly set things right on its head.\"  you can even buy ayahuasca powders and extracts online and in the local markets in the peruvian amazon, but gorman warns \"you do not  know what it would be.\"  as more and more western tourists consume ayahuasca, gorman says it has him worried. \"i have  had this feeling in my bones for five or six years that something could go slightly wrong here that could sour a lot of stuff.\"  some ayahuasca tourists have died  in april,   year old briton henry miller died after taking part in an ayahuasca ceremony in colombia, according to various media reports. and kyle nolan, an   year old from northern california, died under similar circumstances in august   in peru.  the shaman who provided nolan with the ayahuasca and who initially lied about his death was sentenced to three years in prison, his mother, ingeborg oswald, told cnn.  there have been other reported deaths, as well as reports of physical and sexual assaults. writer lily kay ross says she survived sexual abuse by an ayahuasca shaman.  \"we have to take seriously the potential for harm alongside the huge potential for benefit,\" ross says on a video on a fundraising website for the ethnobotanical stewardship council. \"standards of safety and ethics would go a long way in making sure that this kind of abuse is not  experienced by anyone else.\"  ron wheelock, an american shaman who leads an ayahuasca healing center in the peruvian amazon, says he fears there may be more deaths.  \"i hate to say it, yes there probably will be,\" he told lisa ling. \"it is  in the cards\"  theres a movement to create safe ayahuasca  through indiegogo.com, the ethnobotanical stewardship council is raising money to create a health guide for ayahuasca centers in the amazon, so tourists know which centers are safe and harvesting the plants in a sustainable manner that supports the local communities.  the idea would be to put the escs logo outside ayahuasca ceremony sites to signify those centers that meet the councils criteria for safety and sustainability.  in addition, there are efforts to study the medicinal benefits of ayahuasca so that it can be regulated and legalized in the united states, explains rick doblin, executive director of the multidisciplinary association of psychedelic studies.  \"at a time when drug policy is being reevaluated, when marijuana looks like it is  on the road toward legalization, when psychedelic medicine is moving forward through the fda and we can envision a time when psychedelics are available as prescription medicines, how ayahuasca should be handled in a regulatory context is really up in the air,\" doblin said.   highlight  ayahuasca, or yage, is a brew made from a plant in the

has dedicated years of work to maritime migration, and as an italian citizen, i am grateful to the italian council of ministers for taking such an unprecedented decision to make this declaration.  today we honor the memory and the families of more than   refugees, young adults, women, and children from eritrea, retrieved off the southern italian island of lampedusa; and of the many dozens who are still trapped at the bottom of the sea. we also honor the selfless work of the islands residents, tourists, armed forces, medical personnel, and fishermen who have now rescued thousands on their way to europe.  but i have listened uncomfortably to national and eu politicians who, as usual, have pointed their finger at smugglers, purporting that redoubling efforts to fight them will prevent further loss of life at sea. people at the helm of american eaworthy vessels are menial laborers executing the last and risky part of trips organized by transnational criminal networks.  smugglers are not the reason why people are on those vessels. italian and eu institutions are asking what can be done to prevent further tragedies. to answer, they have to ask also whether they did anything to enable them in the first place, including failing to consider implications and alternatives of their specific actions and inactions.  i need to raise a seemingly simple question. what brings thousands of people to trust criminals, pay them   times more than they would pay a comfortable seat on a ferry or airplane, and risk their lives  the overarching answer, in its brutal obviousness, is that they may not legally get on those planes and ferries.  they come from countries, such as eritrea, that methodically oppress their own citizens and will not grant passports and exit visas. they are refugees, forced to leave home without the time and resources to secure legal passage. they have survived the sahara, and returning from libya or egypt is not a feasible and rational option. they are poor. they fail to offer the financial guarantees requested by european consulates, and will not be granted a visa.  quotas and legal channels for employment are inadequate both to their needs and to the needs of european economies and aging populations. they are prepared to die as they leave with hope, but do not wish to survive in despair. they fall through the immense cracks of a system that needs them for a job or might grant them asylum, but only if they first make it through miles of peril and years of exploitation.  it is evident then, that the mediterranean chronicle of death cannot end merely as a result of tougher penalties on smugglers, additional resources for search and rescue operations, and heightened military surveillance and dissuasion. prisons, radars, and helicopters are not solutions. every institution, at every level of governance, needs radical action.  fishermen and shipmasters should not have to fear that rescuing people will result in criminal charges for aiding and abetting undocumented immigrants. or are they to engage in racial profiling and evaluate in hectic moments whether somebody in distress is a refugee or an undocumented economic immigrant  should they rescue the former, but abandon the latter and perhaps face prosecution for failure to rescue  can these decisions, and peoples life, be left to discretion, chance, and the elements   eu intergovernmental border patrols  frontex  and national armed forces need to clarify, to themselves and to citizens, whether they patrol the mediterranean to deter migration, to rescue people, or to intercept and deport them to countries of origin and transit.  safe, legal channel needed\\'  citizens need to remember that in liberal democracies it is on their behalf and in their name that laws are written and implemented. they need to demonstrate to lawmakers that they are not \"afraid\" of their eritrean, syrian, somali, egyptian, afghani, iraqi, ghanaian, bangladeshi and pakistani employees, fiancã©s, neighbors, schoolmates, and coworkers, to mention the nationalities increasingly resorting to maritime journeys.  what happens with boundaries of socio economic inclusion and integration is related to what happens at the border. national and eu policymakers need to envision a common family reunification and asylum policy, and establish more homogenous parameters for asylum adjudication. this could help curb the equally perilous journeys of hope of many afghanis across the strait of otranto, from greece to italy and then to northern europe.  most urgently, national and eu policymakers need to establish accessible, safe, and legal channels for internally and internationally displaced people to apply for asylum or to be granted temporary protection.  these are not problems only concerning smugglers, immigrants, and refugees. this national day of mourning is a call for the eu and its member states to start refashioning what sovereignty and humanitarianism mean in the  st century. it is an invitation to fellow italian and european citizens, including migrants and their children, to practise democracy in its representative and participatory dimensions. and it serves as yet another reminder of north south disparities in wealth and power, signaled by the fact that the mediterranean is a frontier in the first place.  there is no single solution to the mediterranean chronicle of death. there are certainly alternatives to this state of affairs. they are more rational, and more just, than inaction and methodic negligence.   highlight  smugglers are not why people are on these vessels, writes maurizio albahari   highlight  quotas inadequate both to refugees and european economies, he says   highlight  albahari  eu nations must establish safe,

is not allowed to register one of them as its trademark, the european court of justice has ruled.  the danish company was granted a trademark for a three dimensional image of a red eight stud brick in  , for use throughout the european union.  canadian toy manufacturer mega brands, which makes similar plastic bricks, argued that lego violated trademark legislation, and the european court of justice in luxembourg ruled in favor of mega brands on tuesday.  \"this was the court of final instance, and we have no option but to note the courts ruling,\" said peter kjaer, the head of legos intellectual property section.  the ruling cannot be appealed.  the issue was whether the famous lego brick served a technical function. european law says companies can trademark graphic images like words, designs, the shape of their goods and packaging    but trademarking a products shape, if that shape is \"necessary to obtain a technical result,\" is not allowed, the court said.  lego argued that did not apply to its brick, because \"bricks with virtually the same function can have other appearances,\" kjaer said.  in making its decision, the court referred to an earlier case involving the electronics makers philips and remington over the shape of an electric razor.  \"patents can protect technical solutions, such as the means to interconnect toy bricks, but patent protection is limited in time and legos patents for the basic brick have long expired,\" mega brands said in a statement after the ruling. \"put simply, a trademark registration cannot be used to confer a potentially everlasting monopoly on a useful product configuration.\"  kjaer said the decision will confuse lego customers.  \"it is naturally a matter of concern to us that use of the brick by others can dilute the trademark,\" he said. \"but the worst aspect is that consumers will be misled. analyses show that     percent of shoppers believe they are buying a lego product when in fact they are purchasing a different product. shoppers can see there is a different name on the box, but they believe it is a product line or company owned by us.\"   highlight  lego may not trademark its iconic plastic brick

and south korea are haggling over the date and time of the potential meetings.  the proposed talks are the clearest sign yet of an improvement in the severely strained relations between the two sides after north korea set off months of american ettling tensions with a long range rocket launch in december followed by an underground nuclear test in february.  the north broke the impasse between the two sides over the kaesong industrial zone    a major symbol of cooperation between the two countries where pyongyang halted activity in april    by issuing a proposal on thursday for talks.  it said that \"the venue of the talks and the date for their opening can be set to the convenience of the south side.\"  south korea reacted quickly and positively to the offer, noting that it had been \"continuously\" seeking talks on kaesong since the north shut it down. the souths unification minister, ryoo kihl jae, suggested the two sides hold ministerial level talks in seoul on wednesday.  on friday morning, the north expressed appreciation for the souths response. it said it thinks that \"working contact\" between the two governments is necessary before ministerial talks, proposing that the lower level meeting take place in kaesong on sunday.  it also said it would meet a request from the south to reopen on friday the red cross liaison channel in the border area of panmunjom, an important line of communication between the two sides that the north cut off as tensions flared earlier this year.  south korean officials did not  immediately respond to the norths latest statement friday.  the shuttered kaesong complex is one of the main casualties of the recent period of fiery threats and provocative moves by north korea.  in early april, kim jong american  regime began blocking south koreans from entering the manufacturing complex, which sits on the norths side of the heavily fortified border and houses the operations of more than   south korean companies.  pyongyang then pulled out the more than  ,  north koreans who work in the zones factories, saying it was temporarily suspending activity there. the last south koreans in the zone left last month.  the north korean decision to halt operations surprised some observers, since kaesong was considered an important source of hard currency for kim jong american  regime.  the proposal for talks regarding the complex indicates that \"maybe the cost of closure of kaesong is greater than they had anticipated,\" said daniel pinkston, a senior analyst for the international crisis group covering northeast asia.  at the same time, pinkston said, north koreas key ally, china, which has expressed displeasure with some of pyongyangs recent behavior, may not have been \"as generous as the north koreans have been expecting in terms of aid, assistance, trade and investment.\"  the norths menacing rhetoric against the united states and south korea hit a fever pitch in march and april after the united nations . security council voted in march to slap tougher sanctions on the regime and amid american . south korean military drills in the region. the united nations . sanctions were in response to the norths third underground nuclear test, which took place in february.  the american . south korean military exercises have since ended, and pyongyang has toned down the frequency and intensity of its threats.  north koreas behavior suggests it was willing to \"go to the brink and try to rattle\" new south korean president park geun hye and other governments, pinkston said.  \"but i do not  think that really happened,\" he said. \"south korea and its allies in the international community demonstrated their resolve and unwillingness to back down in the face of north korean rhetoric.\"  the norths statement thursday also proposed that the potential talks cover other issues besides the kaesong complex. it mentioned the possibility of resuming cross border tours at mount kumgang, a north korean resort where a south korean tourist was shot by a north korean soldier in   after allegedly walking into an off limits area.  pyongyang said the talks could also include \"humanitarian issues\" such as \"the reunion of separated families and their relatives.\"  the north korean proposal did not, however, mention anything about the norths controversial nuclear and missile programs, which lie at the heart of the tensions surrounding north korea.  kim jong american  regime chose a symbolic date on which to make its offer of talks. june   is memorial day in south korea, when citizens

deliberated a full day without reaching a verdict thursday in the trial of a man accused of killing the mother, brother and   year old nephew of entertainer jennifer hudson.  william balfour, hudsons former brother in law, faces charges of first degree murder, home invasion, residential burglary and possession of a stolen vehicle. he has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyer has argued that there is no forensic evidence linking him to the killings.  heated closing arguments wednesday set a tense tone in the courtroom before the judge sent the   jurors into deliberations.  the singer actress kept her head down during much of cook county prosecutor jennifer bagbys closing argument.  after showing autopsy photos of the victims, bagby pointed toward balfour.  \"it is  time to hold him responsible,\" she said.  \"they have failed to prove their case,\" balfours attorney amy thompson said wednesday during her closing argument, her voice rising. \"he is on trial for his life.\"  thompson argued that police homed in on balfour rather than conducting a full investigation.  \"in their mind, this was not  a whodunnit,\" she said.  no dna evidence points to balfour, said thompson, who also questioned police work in the case, describing a set of keys that she said surfaced on an evidence list a month after the slayings.  \"those keys show how desperate the state was. they resorted to this. ... my client is an innocent man,\" she said.  but prosecutors argued that physical and circumstantial evidence links balfour to the killings and described as \"absurd\" defense claims that police may have planted evidence or been part of a conspiracy to frame balfour.  prosecutor jim mckay told jurors that there was a \"tsunami of circumstantial evidence.\"  \"the circumstantial facts of this case are drowning this guy in guilt,\" he said.  bagby said in her closing argument that balfour had threatened to kill the family of julia hudson, jennifer hudsons sister.  \"if you leave me, i will  kill you. i will  kill your family first. you will  be the last to die,\" he had said, according to bagby.  \"he went in that house for one reason, and one reason only, to carry out that threat,\" bagby told jurors.  balfour is accused of fatally shooting hudsons mother, darnell donerson,  , and the singers brother, jason hudson,  , in their chicago home in october  . the body of hudsons   year old nephew, julian king, was found three days later in an abandoned vehicle.  prosecutors have portrayed balfour as a jealous man who murdered the three people in a rage at the thought that his wife had a boyfriend.  in her closing argument, bagby said balfour shot hudsons mother as she tried to defend herself with a broom.  \"he fired that gun at her over and over and over,\" bagby said.  mckay called balfour \"a true coward.\"  \"he shoots a   year old grandmother in the back. he shoots a   year old man in his sleep. he shoots a   year old twice in the head,\" mckay told jurors. \"the family, the community, the city, the country demand justice.\"  there have been   witnesses and   days of testimony in the trial.  hudson, who was on hand through the trial, was called as the prosecutions first witness. she broke down in tears several times on the stand as she recalled her family.  \"none of us wanted her to marry him,\" hudson said of her sisters decision to marry balfour. \"we did not like how he treated her.  \"where he was, i tried not to be,\" she said.  the deaths took place a year after hudson, who rose to fame as a contestant on \"american idol,\" won an oscar for her role in the movie \"dreamgirls.\"  in a recent interview with cnns piers morgan, hudson reflected on the life of her mother.  \"my mother was a very wise and strong person. i feel like she raised us well, and she prepared me well, and so thats what i live by,\" she said.  her career has continued to blossom and remains varied since her relatives\\' deaths.

activist anna hazare began a public hunger strike in the countrys capital friday, accompanied by thousands of cheering supporters.  the   year old campaigner, who is seeking stronger anti corruption measures in india, was greeted by crowds as he left a jailhouse in new delhi earlier to make his way to the citys large ramlila grounds.  he will stage the two week protest there after police relaxed their conditions. supporters say he began fasting while still in jail.  hazare traveled from the jail in an open top truck decorated with indian flags, as thousands of citizens marched along.  before arriving at ramlila grounds    known mostly as a venue for massive political rallies, demonstrations and religious festivals    the campaigner visited the shrine to mahatma gandhi, the man who led the nations independence struggle, to pay homage.  flanked by admirers, he dropped petals and bowed at the memorial in a traditional indian gesture of respect.  once at the rain lashed ramlila grounds, hazare sat on a makeshift podium with a large gandhi backdrop as crowds carrying umbrellas hailed his arrival.  addressing the crowds, he called his campaign indias \"second fight for independence.\"  he said, \"we got independence in   and the white  the british rulers  left our country. but theres no end to corruption, crime and looting. this is now our second fight for independence. whether or not i live, this fight will go on.\"  speaking earlier outside the jailhouse, dressed in his usual plain cotton attire, hazare had also made references to indias freedom movement, with passionate cries of \"hail revolution and hail motherland.\"  his brief address at the gates of tihar prison, from which he was officially released three days ago, was almost drowned out by the crowds noise.  anti corruption campaigners have rejected legislation prepared by the federal government to create a citizen ombudsman, saying the bill, now in parliament, is too weak to tackle endemic graft in the system.  led by hazare, they have been demanding a stronger institution that they say should be capable of tackling corruption indians encounter in their daily lives.  supporters see the elderly anti corruption crusader as a second gandhi. his hunger strikes are also modelled after the protest mode gandhi used in his movement against the colonial rule that ended in  .  however, indian leaders say hazares demands undermine democracy, through his use of a protest tactic gandhi used in very different circumstances.  \"i acknowledge that shri  mr.  anna hazare may be inspired by high ideals in his campaign to set up a strong and effective lok pal  citizen ombudsman ,\" prime minister manmohan singh told parliament on wednesday.  \"however, the path that he has chosen to impose his draft of a bill upon parliament is totally misconceived and fraught with grave consequences for our parliamentary democracy.\"  hazare was sent to jail on tuesday because he planned to stage his strike at a different public place without official permission, police said.  but as support swelled for the activist, with thousands of people hitting the streets in indian cities, authorities ordered his release within hours of his arrest.  yet, in a rare show of protest, he refused to depart the jail until police agreed to allow him to stage his hunger strike in the open air as planned.  the

minimize infants\\' exposure to the chemical bisphenol a, the food and drug administration said friday in an announcement that stopped short of saying there is a definite health risk from the chemical.  in guidelines published on its web site, the fda said it has \"some concern\" about the safety of bpa, and supports efforts by industry to remove bpa from infant bottles and feeding cups.  dr. josh sharfstein, deputy fda commissioner, said the agency is trying to determine whether it has the legal authority to quickly force such products off the market if manufacturers do not  do it voluntarily. according to sharfstein, the six largest makers of infant bottles and cups already use alternatives to bpa.  bisphenol a is found in many products, but has drawn the most attention for its use in linings for canned food and infant formula, and as a hardener in plastic baby bottles and toys. a handful of states and cities including minnesota, connecticut, massachusetts and chicago, illinois, have passed laws in some form banning bpa in products meant for children.  the new position is a partial reversal of the fdas declaration in   that bpa has no adverse effects. that announcement came under fire from environmental groups that said it relied too heavily on industry funded research.  since then, the agency says on its web site, \"recent studies have reported subtle effects of low doses of bpa in laboratory animals. while bpa is not proven to harm children or adults, these newer studies have led federal health officials to express some concern about the safety of bpa.\"  the new position brings the fda into line with guidance from the national toxicology program, which in its own   report said there is \"some concern\" for bpas effects on the brain, behavior and prostate gland, in developing fetuses, infants and children. other studies have found a possible link to diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but the authors of those studies say it is  not clear the problems were actually caused by bpa.  at a news conference friday, fda commissioner margaret hamburg said further research is needed \"to determine if and when further action is needed.\"  the national institute of environmental health sciences has been allotted    million to study the health effects of bpa. hamburg said that research would likely be complete in   to   months. in a separate review, the environmental protection agency is weighing whether to list bpa as a chemical of concern under the federal toxic substances control act, which would trigger a formal process to develop possible restrictions on bpa.  at the news conference, hamburg and sharfstein urged parents to keep the risk in perspective, saying the benefits of nutritious infant formula outstrip any potential danger from bpa. other guidance includes   â\\x80¢ discarding scratched or worn bottles and cups, which aside from harboring germs might also release small amounts of bpa  â\\x80¢ being careful when heating formula, as boiling or very hot liquid might cause the release of bpa into infant formula  â\\x80¢ checking labels to ensure that only microwave safe products are used in the microwave, and dishwasher safe products are put in the dishwasher, to avoid leakage  in taking a middle ground, the fda managed to frustrate both industry and consumer safety groups.  steven hentges, a scientist with the american chemistry councils global study group on bpa, said the guidance would \"confuse consumers,\" while a scientist with the natural resources defense council said the move was \"too little, too late.\"  hentges painted the fda decision as a victory, saying the announcement reflects scientific consensus \"that these products continue to be safe for use.\" however, he complained that there was no scientific basis for the advice to discard older bottles and cups and insisted that studies have failed to find evidence of actual harm from bpa.  sara janssen, a scientist with the natural resources defense council, agreed the advice was confusing, but said the fda should have gone further and banned the use of bpa.  sonya lunder, a senior analyst with the environmental working group and a longtime bpa critic, says mothers can largely avoid bpa by using powdered formula instead of liquid. but she welcomed fridays announcement.  \"this is a huge step forward. the bush

for the death penalty.  the penalty phase of the trial is set to begin february  . cutts will face a sentence of either   years to life with the possibility of parole,   years to life with the possibility of parole, life without parole or death.  as the verdicts were read, cutts remained stoic, a stark contrast to his tearful testimony on monday.  watch the verdicts â»  his and davis\\' families left  the courthouse without comment.  jurors began deliberations late tuesday afternoon. they had been sequestered, spending nights at a nearby hotel, cut off from exposure to the media and other potential influences.  according to testimony, cutts,  , rolled davis\\' body in a comforter and dumped it in a park, leaving their  â½ year old son, blake, alone.  cutts also was found guilty of aggravated burglary, two counts of gross abuse of a corpse and endangering a child, blake.  cutts sobbed on the witness stand as he admitted killing davis and their unborn child. but cutts insisted that their deaths were an accident.  \"i did not  mean to hurt her,\" cutts testified, clasping a handful of tissues. \"this is not  real,\" he said he kept telling himself.  prosecutors discounted cutts\\' story, claiming he buckled under the financial pressure of child support, killed the mother of his child and then created a cover story to try to get away with it.  on the stand, cutts said he went to pick up his son blake and became agitated when davis,  , was not  moving fast enough to get the boy ready. he said he tried to leave her house but she grabbed him to keep him from leaving, and he accidentally elbowed her in the throat.  cutts told the jury he performed cpr on davis and then tried to revive her with bleach. when he realized davis was dead, cutts said he panicked and put her in the back of his truck, so blake would not  have to see his mother.  myisha ferrell, cutts\\' longtime friend, testified for the prosecution that cutts appeared at her home at   a.m. after davis died.  she said she could tell he was distraught. when they left her home in his truck, she found out why.  \"we drove off and he said something was wrong,\" she said. \"he said, something bad.\\' \"  \"he said something was wrong with his babys mother.\"  ferrell told the jury cutts started speaking erratically as they drove, then blurted out, \"shes in the back.\"  ferrell admitted she helped dump davis\\' body in a field and said cutts later coached her on what to say to police.  ferrell was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to lying to authorities and complicity to gross abuse of a corpse.  during closing arguments, prosecutor dennis barr said cutts strangled and killed davis and her unborn child because of his mounting debt and child support for what would have been his fourth child.  cutts\\' own actions following davis\\' disappearance were a clear indications of his guilt, he said.  \"his reaction is the reaction of person who committed a crime and is trying to cover it up,\" barr said.  davis disappeared in june and the search for her attracted national attention. at that time, cutts repeatedly denied he had any involvement. but cutts eventually led police to her body.  \"for nine days he kept the location of [davis\\' body] a secret and went on about his life, every day knowing that jessie and chloe were laying there rotting away, destroying the evidence,\" barr said.  prosecutors also reminded the jury of the testimony of one of cutts\\' friends, richard mitchell, who claimed the former police officer threatened to kill davis one month before she disappeared.  \"i am  going to kill that [expletive] and throw her in the woods,\" mitchell quoted cutts as saying.  in their closings, cutts\\' attorneys acknowledged their clients poor judgment after davis\\' death, but said the prosecution had not presented any witnesses to support their claim that cutts was in financial distress.  they urged the jury to find cutts not guilty on the basis that the prosecution did not prove their case that he intentionally killed davis.  fernando mack, a defense lawyer, admitted cutts\\' judgment lapsed when he wrapped davis\\' body up and went to dispose of it, leaving their toddler alone with the bleach soaked rug.  but he cautioned jurors against deciding cutts\\' fate based on an emotional response to ugly facts. \"will it outrage you  absolutely. but, blake being left home alone does not  tell you about aggravated murder.\"  \"you do not  know what happened in that house,\" defense attorney carolyn ranke said. email to a

trains speed may have played in the crash.  the issue of high speed rail may raise more questions for the public at large, specifically in the united states, where high speed trains are rare. here are some basics on this speedy mode of transportation   what is high speed rail   it depends where you are, but the international union of railways says the term is reserved for systems  not just trains  designed for speeds of more than   kph    mph  if the lines are new and speeds up to   kph    mph  if the lines are upgraded.  certain trains in china and the european union can exceed   kph    mph , while a handful around the world can top   kph    mph .  the term can also be used for trains that move at speeds between   kph and   kph    mph to   mph  in certain circumstances, such as the need to avoid \"noise and nuisance,\" or the need to traverse long tunnels or bridges.  how is high speed rail different from nation to nation   as stated above, china and the eu have trains that can exceed   kph    mph , which means, in china, trains can zip between beijing and wuhan in about five hours. the regular train route takes twice as long, and you would  be lucky to finish the journey in a car in   hours.  in japan, the shinkansen bullet trains typically travel at between   kph    mph  and   kph    mph , while korea train express cars can travel up to   kph    mph .  in march, koreas hemu  x hit a speed of  .  kph   .  mph  in a test run, making korea the fourth country    behind france, china and japan    to develop a train capable of topping   kph    mph .  spain has high speed trains, known as aves, that move at speeds up to   kph    mph , according to railway gazette, but the train involved in this weeks wreck was not an ave. it had a max speed of   kph    mph .  is high speed rail available in the united states   amtrak operates a service in the northeastern united states called acela express that is capable of speeds up to   kph    mph  and can travel between new york city and washington in about   minutes. other stops on the route include boston, philadelphia, baltimore and new haven, connecticut.  responding to critics who say acela is too slow and too infrequently reaches its top speed, amtrak announced in september that it plans to run test trains at    kph    mph  in delaware, maryland, new jersey, rhode island and massachusetts.  what does the future hold for high speed rail in the american .   early in the obama administration, federal transportation officials called on states to spend money to develop faster rail systems using existing lines.  the plan identified   potential high speed corridors for federal funding, and the white house proposed spending    billion over   years to create the national network. among the corridors  california, the pacific northwest, the midwest, the southeast, the gulf coast, pennsylvania, florida, new york and new england. the blueprint envisioned some trains traveling at top speeds of more than   mph.  but there have been many snafus.  in  , transportation secretary roy lahood redirected    million from wisconsin and    million from ohio after those states\\' governors cited opposition to the projects.  the tussle over budget cuts further hampered funding in  . that same year, florida gov. rick scott rejected a plan to run high speed rail between tampa and orlando  and eventually spread to miami and jacksonville . florida subsequently lost   .  billion in federal funding, and   states submitted requests for portions of floridas allotted money.  in california, billions of federal dollars were pledged for high speed rail, and voters ok would     billion in bonds for a bullet train between san diego and san francisco, but the project has been set back by myriad issues.  are there safeguards in place in the american . that would help prevent a disaster like the one in spain   yes. in fact, those safety regulations may be at the core of why it is  difficult for high speed rail to proliferate in the united states.  according to a june report from the competitive enterprise institute, a libertarian think tank, the federal railroad administration \"has strict crash safety regulation for passenger railcars which trains in europe    where passenger rail is well established and remarkably safe    do not have to meet.\"  while the american . requires the undercarriage of a train to withstand  ,  pounds of force without \"permanent deformation,\" europe designs \"trains to gracefully deform in a controlled manner\" so that crumple zones absorb the energy of the crash, an approach known as crash energy management.  the \"buff strength\" for european trains is  ,  pounds of force, according to the think tank.  the fra has other requirements not present in european safety regulations, including requiring that the end of the train have the resistive strength of a half inch plate of steel and an \"anti climbing mechanism\" that prevents train cars from telescoping and mounting each other.  \"the requirements force amtrak and transit authorities across the country to purchase custom made trains that are united nations ecessarily expensive, underperform and do not meet the best safety practices of the rest of the world,\" the cei report said.   highlight  high speed rail can range in speed from   kph to more than   kph   highlight  some

and pray that this latest round of negotiations succeeds in bringing us stability and progress towards peace.  the recent violence has left many dead and wounded, homeless and traumatized on both sides, as well as terrible destruction. worst of all, it has overwhelmed many of us with a sense of hopelessness regarding the prospects for peace here.  both the hamas leadership and the israeli government have chosen conflict over real peace negotiations again and again in the past. they are apparently only able to haggle over ceasefire deals between rounds of fighting.  the lead up to the outbreak of hostilities included the wave of mutual hatred and fear that swept the jewish and palestinian populations in the wake of the kidnapping and murder of three young israeli teenagers in the etzion bloc and the revenge murder of a palestinian youth in shuafat, followed by israeli mass arrests of hamas operatives in the west bank, and the arrest of three jewish extremists in the jerusalem region.  israel had also signaled its disapproval of the recently established fatah hamas unity government by exacerbating its blockade of gaza, punishing  .  million gazans.  hamas responded by unilaterally opening fire and shooting hundreds of missiles at israeli population centers. the rest is well known    operation protective edge with the destruction and death you have seen on tv screen and other media. if not for the iron dome anti missile batteries  an israeli invention with american . investment  protecting those cities, the destruction and deaths on the israeli side would have been much greater.  we israelis on the whole supported this action, though there were some protests from the radical left and arab citizens. the internal arguments regarding  frozen  negotiations with palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas and the future of the settlements were set aside as the country was mobilized to support the armed forces in what was seen as an act of defense against the rocket fire.  a week later, with the onset of the ground offensive, the destruction of the many tunnels dug into our territory for purposes of kidnapping and terrorist killings became the focus of popular support for the idf. my son, an infantry soldier in reserves, was called up to protect his people, as i have had to do in the past, and as my father did in poland when fighting the germans as a partisan.  on the other hand, few israelis questioned the means by which we deal with these threats or whether the path to this bloodshed was indeed unavoidable. fewer israelis wanted to hear criticism of the rising numbers of uninvolved palestinian dead and wounded from the idfs actions.  those of us in the human rights community who asked questions about this, however carefully and hesitantly, were vilified as unpatriotic or even as traitors, and some activists were physically attacked.  faced with these reactions, i fear for israeli democracy and the moral fiber of the country. when faced with a struggle with a hate fueled terrorist organization like hamas, which has no compunction in breaking even humanitarian ceasefire agreements  they broke five or six , and which uses its own civilian population for cover, it is understandable that israeli nerves might be frayed.  the strength of my country and my people through history has always been its ability to debate, be self critical, and respect differences of opinion.  there is certainly no prospect for peace here in israel if the extremists within the present government have their way. if the palestinians, on the other hand, are able to change direction and reject the ways of hamas as uncompromising haters of israels very existence, they would strengthen the hand of the many israelis who continue to dream and strive for peace.  some of us see that as a religious commandment    as hillel the elder said  sayings of the fathers, chapt.  , mishna  , talmud , one should pursue peace as did aharon the high

recently.  on thursday, the social media company announced that its photo app instagram was adding support for   second videos, a la twitters hit vine app.  there are a few minor differences  vine is only   seconds; instagram has filters; vine loops; instagram lets you delete a clip. but they are essentially the same tool.  this is not the first time facebook has tried replicating another companys features. it imitated foursquare with its places check ins, instagram with the camera app, twitter with profiles you can follow and snapchat with the poke app. last week, facebook finally added hashtags, another creation started on twitter, though the outrage seems to be more that it took so long.  while perhaps disappointing, it is american urprising that a minor feature gets so much media coverage  yes. this is my third article on the topic . facebook has more than a billion users around the world. instagram says   million people use the photo sharing service every month, and most will be excited to get a cool new feature like video. in just   hours,   million videos were uploaded to the service, according to instagram.  what happens on these tools, even when they are tiny, has an immediate impact on a huge amount of people.  \"facebook is a very important company in the world,\" said brian singerman, a partner at the founders fund investment firm. \"anything facebook does impacts a billion people. that in and of itself, becoming a communications platform for a billion people, is a pretty impressive feat in the world.\"  the small features can also have big impacts on the company itself. originality is risky, and facebook is now a public company tasked with making investors money after a particularly harrowing first year on the stock market.  for facebook, advertising, particularly on mobile devices, is where that money will come from. in  ,    of facebooks revenue came from advertising, and videos are going to play a bigger role in future online advertising revenue.  there are no paid ads on instagram yet, but it is very brand savvy. a handful of major companies seem to have been given early access to the new feature and posted promotional videos on the service. major companies to post such videos include burberry, the los angeles dodgers, gap and mtv.  the practice of an established company copying successful features is not  new or particular surprising.  according to chris dixon of silicon valley investment firm andreessen horowitz, this is the same pattern that happened   or   years ago with microsoft. intuit would build a cool product for windows, and then microsoft would copy it. borrowing features from other companies and improving on them is part of being competitive.  \"it is  always a threat, but then you see these things break out,\" dixon said.  facebooks track record has been hit or miss. snapchat could be one of those breakouts it did not  manage to squash. the independent mobile messaging app has grown in popularity while facebooks poke app has not  caught on.  experts say facebooks recent spate of arguably ho hum announcements is not  an accurate representation of silicon valley as a whole. many early stage companies, they say, are taking the big risks and working on technology that will change the world.  \"silicon valley is not just about apps for smartphones and doing a photo sharing app that has a blue border instead of a red one,\" singerman said.  founders funds own peter thiel was an early investor in facebook, but the firm is now focused on finding companies with very large

defending his book to reporters.  phillip greaves, who was arrested monday in colorado, said \"the pedophiles guide to love and pleasure  a child lovers code of conduct\" can be used as a guide to rehabilitating pedophiles, and    instead of teaching them how to avoid arrest    teaches them to avoid illegal actions.  asked if he is a pedophile, greaves said, \"i only have sex with grown ups.\" he said he has no children and \"i do not  keep children around my house.\"  polk county, florida, sheriff grady judd has said his detectives were able to establish jurisdiction in the case by conducting an undercover operation, buying the book through the mail.  greaves protested tuesday he is the target of entrapment, but judd disagreed.  \"he wrote this book, he published this book, he put it on amazon to sell,\" judd told reporters as greaves was booked into the polk county jail, \"and he freely responded to our desire to purchase it.\"  greaves and his book gained national attention this year after amazon.com defended selling the book despite angry comments and threats of boycotts. the book was removed from the website in november.  officials said the book talks about safe sex and avoiding injury to children, grooming and preparing children for sex and teaching children how to lie to their parents.  judd said greaves\\' book outlines a \"code of ethics\" that shows pedophiles how to look for the most vulnerable children.  greaves told reporters tuesday he wrote the book to exorcise his own childhood. he said he was introduced to sex at age   by a   year old

toobins assessment of the case.  \"this has nothing to do with free speech and everything to do with obscenity,\" judd said. \"we had a law in florida that applied. we only needed jurisdiction.\"  he said the book violates florida law. \"theres too much hand wringing across the nation. when we ca not  stand together as a nation and say you ca not  write a book with real stories of children being sexually abused, then it is  time to change the law.\"  judd said of greaves  \"clearly, in our opinion, hes a pedophile. ... the guy is clearly trying to instruct people how to sexually abuse children, a step by step instruction guide with real life examples. thats against the obscenity law in florida, and we are  excited to take it to court.\"  referring to toobins comments about the book being just words, he said, \"words become actions, and words in and of themselves can get you in trouble. if you threaten the president, you are  in trouble. ... there are limits to what you can do.\"

the protective magnetic field surrounding the earth. the magnetic field forces the particles toward the north and south poles. about   to   miles overhead, the particles bump into the earths atmosphere and become electrically \"excited\"    throwing off light of various colors, said prof. dirk lummerzheim of the university of alaska, fairbanks.  \"the forecast for this winter is a

administration said tuesday.  the chemist, annie dookhan,  , already is facing a total of   counts including obstruction of justice, mishandling of drug evidence and lying about holding a masters degree in chemistry from the university of massachusetts.  dookhan worked as a state chemist testing drug evidence submitted by law enforcement agencies from   until march  , when she resigned, according to the massachusetts attorney generals office.  the attorney generals office began a criminal investigation in july  , after massachusetts state police were tipped off by dookhans co workers who alleged her work might be unreliable. the investigation revealed that dookhan allegedly tampered with evidence by altering substances in vials that were being tested at the state lab, allegedly to cover up the practice of routinely \"dry labbing\" samples. \"dry labbing\" is a term used for merely visually identifying samples instead of performing the required chemical test.  authorities arrested dookhan at her home in franklin, massachusetts last september, but she was released on   ,  cash bail with conditions, according to the state attorney generals office.  dookhan has pleaded not guilty to all charges.  former massachusetts chemist faces even more charges  after ordering that the lab where she worked be shut down in august  , while the investigation was ongoing, patrick created a special counsel to expedite the identification of individuals whose cases involved evidence potentially mishandled by dookhan. initially patricks administration estimated  ,  defendants possibly had been affected, but that estimation rose to  ,  after attorney david meier joined patricks special counsel in september. the increase came as no surprise to patricks administration, because there was always an assumption that more information would lead to more discoveries, said heather johnson, a spokeswoman for the administration.  since january, approximately  ,  more names have been identified, bringing the total number of individuals potentially affected to  , , which meier has recorded in a \"master list.\" while some of these added names are in fact new, the majority is not; rather, most are newly identified co defendants of cases that were already on the list, johnson said.     chemist in boston lab scandal handled  ,  drug samples  the \"master list\" is an inventory of names of each person whose drug samples were associated in some way with testing done by dookhan at the drug laboratory, and it is the product of a nearly year long review and an electronic analysis of over three million lab documents, patricks administration said.  according to suffolk district attorneys office spokeswoman rene algarin,   defendants whose cases are potentially affected have been released in suffolk county until the investigation surrounding dookhans alleged evidence tampering is concluded.  but the case against dookhan is complicated by the fact that she faces indictments in seven different massachusetts counties    suffolk, plymouth, middlesex, norfolk, essex, bristol and barnstable    because she had previously testified in various trials in her former official capacity as a chemist.  bridget morton middleton, assistant district attorney for plymouth county, said it is  not just simply coming up with a list of names of defendants. it is  a much more labor intensive process that each of the seven counties must undergo to determine whether a defendants sentence should be put on hold. in some cases, for instance, dookhan was not the primary chemist in a trial and was only agreeing with what another chemist had confirmed, middleton said.  at a news conference tuesday afternoon, meier said he plans to sit down with representatives from the bar associations, district attorneys, prosecutors and chief justices of the various courts to present the material he has gathered. meier, however, made it clear several times that it is not    and was never    his role to assess these documents, but rather to \"get the information into the hands of the appropriate people, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges, so that fundamental fairness and justice can be done in the court rooms.\"  dookhans attorney, nicholas gordon, could not be reached for comment tuesday.  dookhans next court date is set for october   in suffolk superior

eccentric genius who was renowned for his cold war defeat of russian chess champ boris spassky in  ; his two decade retreat from chess; and his trip to yugoslavia in  , in defiance of american . sanctions, for a rematch with spassky. after fischer beat spassky again, winning   .  million, he vanished from the scene once more. he spent his later life denouncing the american . and moved to iceland, where he died.  cnn.com asked readers to share their memories of fischer and his sometimes triumphant, often turbulent life. below are a collection of their responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity.  frank taylor of philadelphia, pennsylvania  bobby fischer was simply the best  his aura was the main reason i took up chess, and the more i understood about chess, the more i came to appreciate his sheer genius. like many others, i did have a problem with his anti america, anti semitic outbursts and views, but his chess playing was pure magic. i would  always hoped and dreamed he would make a final appearance and play garry kasparov. what a match that would have been. what a loss of talent.  gregory campbell of lewisville, texas  when i returned home from vietnam, the game between bobby fischer and spassky had just started. i did not play the game that well, but watching bobby play was a welcome home for me. he inspired me to learn more about the game, and in so doing, i was able to recover from the war. i will always remember that game and what bobby has done for me through the game of chess.  susan polgar of lubbock, texas  in spite of his obvious flaws, he will be remembered as \"the king of chess,\" a genius on the board and the man who broke through the iron curtain. i mostly admired him as a chess player and what he did for chess. he put chess on the map in the american . and changed the economic opportunities for chess players. if it were not  for him, demanding reparation and prizes in the \\' s and \\' s, players would not  be making the money they are today.  he was fanatic about chess; he was working on chess most of his life, even years and years after he retired. his dedication, passion and love for the game, it was his life. it was his profession. it was how he expressed himself. it is  symbolic that he died at age  , for the   squares of the chessboard.  tom brabant jr. of lexington, kentucky  bobby fischer was a childhood hero of mine. his match with spassky resounds in my memory like the apollo moon missions, and he inspired me to learn chess. his book on the subject [bobby fischer teaches chess] was a focused treatment of winning chess games  using back rank mates . it was also a wonderful example of \"programmed instruction.\" while i mourn his death, i teach college and would like to believe that a little bit of bobby lives on in my classroom.  daryl bertrand of ottawa, ontario  as a chess player, i have  always been astounded by the mysterious power of bobby fischers play. as a chess teacher, i have  always tried to instill his courage and determination in my students. surely this is the darkest day in the history of chess.  philip skipper of lake charles, louisiana  when i was a young boy, bobby fischer was no less than a hero for me. i am now   years old, and i still have the yellowed newspaper clippings of his famous match with boris spassky in my desk.  unfortunately, bobby obviously suffered from mental illness that progressed as the years passed by and eventually destroyed him. his remarks  ravings  of support for the  /  attackers upon the united states will certainly be as much of a legacy as being the american cold war hero, and first american world chess champion three decades earlier. bobby fischer was a genius, a hero, a villain and a very sick man. it is  a shame that no one could reach him many years ago and save him from himself.  judy winters of port charlotte, florida  bobby fischer was my first boyfriend. starting about  , i would go to the manhattan chess club with my father. my father would play, and i would drink soda. i saw bobby a few times there, and we would talk a little.  we were both the same age and very shy.  i fell in love with him at a tournament at asbury park, in new jersey. we went to the boardwalk together, went on rides and played games of chance. his mother was real mad at him when we got back because he was almost late for his game.  i think it was memorial day or labor day, maybe   or  . the asbury park newspaper had a picture of me watching one of his games. i wish i could get a copy of that picture. we wrote back and forth for a while, and then i got too cool for chess and he got famous. one time, a jewish friend of mine said i could not  marry him because he was jewish and i was not . i wish i could have seen her when he converted.  i love remembering him in such an innocent time. he was just a person, like you and me, with a wonderful gift  and he was very cute . if anyone can get that picture from the asbury park newspaper, please let me know. i think it was on the front page, because we were only about   or  , and he won.  gerry christmas of carrboro, north carolina  what happened

with a global power shift in golf. five years ago, three of the four major champions were american, and all three were members of the pga tour.  today the american . is empty handed. the four majors are held by two south africans, in schwartzel and british open winner louis oosthuizen, a german in martin kaymer  u.s. pga championship , and an irishman in graeme mcdowell  u.s. open .  the pga tour still have three major holders as members    in mcdowell, schwartzel and oosthuizen    but with kaymer, along with chandler stars mcilroy and englands world no.   lee westwood, opting to concentrate on the european tour instead, the pga tour lost out on the memberships of two the top three players in the rankings, and three of the top  .  new breed of super agents  the power base has shifted across the atlantic. and from a management perspective, the traditionally all powerful img agency has been forced to concede some influence.  mcdowell is managed by connor ridge of horizon management in ireland, while kaymer is with johan elliot of swedish based sportyard ab.  img, meanwhile, is without a major winner but it does represent englands luke donald    the latest world no.   in succession to westwood and kaymer following the fall of woods.  no wonder chandler was smiling when we met at londons exclusive jumeirah hotel    dressed in a slick gray suit and open shirt after yet another day of wall to wall meetings.  \"you think we are  powerful, do you ... i was hoping nobody noticed that,\" chandler said.  \"we have  certainly got influence, but i do not  think we use it unfairly. i do not  think it is  an unhealthy situation.\"  snubbing the \"fifth major\"  not everybody would agree. when mcilroy and westwood announced they would skip the pga tours flagship event, the players championship in florida, chandler and his players were widely criticized.  \"moving it to the middle of may has made it about the  th most important tournament in the world,\" chandler said.  \"it is not  a priority for them as they would rather win a major or a world golf championship event.\"  if this was chandler against the pga tour, then he was not  pulling his punches. he wanted the best for his players, and the best meant pulling two of his biggest draws from one of the highest profile tournaments in the world. even if it was not  intentional, it was a quite a power play.  chubby the fixer  chandlers evolution to a super agent began in his   years as a journeyman professional golfer, where he earned a reputation as a man who sourced cheap flights and did things on a budget.  it turned out he was a far better fixer than he was a golfer, and when he retired in  , aged just  , he set up a management agency to make the most of his talents.  \"my big break was when i got a call from darren clarke to meet him over in ireland in  ,\" chandler said.  \"we shook hands on a deal and when i saw him play for the first time i thought, \\'wow, this guy can really play, we have  got a proper business now.\\' \"  word spread quickly, and a week later chandler got a phone call from westwoods father, who wanted to show him a video of his sons swing. a cup of tea later, westwood joined ism, and the foundations were in place for his empire.  chubbys empire  two decades on and ism now looks after the interests of   golfers,   cricketers,   footballers and a paralympic gold medallist.  it employs around   people and has offices in the uk, india, south africa and florida    plus a new base recently acquired in manhattan, new york.  chandlers profile has reached such a level that he regularly gets autograph requests at tournaments    much to the amusement of the likes of westwood and clarke.  and much as ism is a lot more than the one man show it began life as in  , it is  hard to imagine its existence without the showman and ringleader who heads up the operation.  \"i am what i am. i am  straight shooter and i am  blessed with a fair amount of common sense    which stands me in good stead,\" chandler said.  and there speaks arguably the biggest player in golf today.   highlight  andrew \"chubby\" chandler is a former professional golfer

their contract expired in july of   . such negotiations are often difficult and proceed in fits and starts. but in this case, the increasingly contentious and protracted dispute could have major economic consequences for america if it is not  settled soon.  during these negotiations, port operations have gradually slowed as each side seeks to put pressure on the other. the international longshore and warehouse union and the pacific maritime association need to set aside their differences and reach an agreement that will ensure the continued success and competitiveness of these ports. and it is imperative that an agreement be reached without any further slowdowns or shutdowns.  this serious drag in talks threatens to disrupt the american . economic recovery, which is still fragile. the negotiators are not  the ones suffering     it is  all of the other industries, employers and employees throughout the country who depend on goods moving in and out of the ports.  agricultural exports are rotting at the ports, and in some cases, in the fields. they ca not  be picked because they ca not  be shipped. manufacturers are shutting down shifts for lack of imported parts and losing overseas customers because goods are not being shipped, or they are  resorting to air shipments that cost significantly more than traditional shipping methods.  retailers are not getting critical merchandise for the upcoming spring and summer seasons. trucking and railroad companies are either sitting idle or handling far less cargo, and trains are not moving westward because they cannot unload, which is causing disruptions in the rail freight system across the country.  this brinksmanship is also causing long term damage to the reliability of american companies. when international customers ca not  get what they need from american suppliers    both agricultural and manufactured    there are plenty of competitors from other countries ready to step in. once those contracts are lost, they will be very difficult to get back.  similarly, there will be long term consequences for the west coast ports as shippers and those who rely on goods moving in and out of these ports find other ways to bring their cargo into north america    either through canada, mexico or through the expanded panama canal to the gulf and east coast ports. even if a deal was done tomorrow, there will be many months before all the backed up cargo is pushed through the system.  ultimately, if there is a full shutdown, it will cost exporters, importers, shippers and others an estimated    billion a day. the   day shutdown in   cost the economy and estimated    billion a day and took a half year to clear out the backlog of containers.  the situation has reached crisis point, and the parties must find a way to get a deal and get goods moving again.  the situation is so urgent, and distress over the west coast ports has become so widespread, that lawmakers from both sides of the aisle held a news conference at the capitol last week to press for action.  we have called on president barack obama to use his bully pulpit to ramp up the urgency on these negotiations and make clear to the parties that the country is desperate for them to get a deal. we were pleased to see that president obama dispatched secretary of labor thomas perez to california to meet with the parties and convey to them the desperate need to find a resolution. we have  been encouraged that secretary perez has reached out to learn about the impacts this stalemate is causing throughout the country.  if a full shutdown does occur, we will request that the president use his full authority under the taft hartley act to force the parties back into negotiations and keep the ports open. the answer, though, is for the parties to come together now and reach an agreement.   highlight  labor negotiations on west coast ports will have major economic impact if the dispute is not  settled soon   highlight  thomas

yet again this holiday season.  so far this november,   .  billion has been spent online, comscore estimated, marking a    increase versus the corresponding days last year. wednesday, november  , has been the heaviest online spending day to date at    million.  \"with the persistent backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty and continued high unemployment, consumers appear to be increasingly favoring

more than one third say they are  offering free shipping earlier this year than last year.  among digital shoppers, it is  perhaps not surprising that electronic gadgets appear at the top of the shopping list.  consumer electronics site retrevos polling results showed that almost one third      of its respondents will be searching for a deal on a tablet computer this year.  in an interesting twist that might point to the future of the tablet market, the same number of people said they hope to get a kindle fire this year      as said they want an ipad. the    fire actually finished slightly ahead of the ipad, which starts at   , among men in the survey.  high definition televisions were next at   , with laptops and smartphones following close behind.  retrevo has not  just been polling shoppers, either. their gadget folks have rounded up some lists to help with your online shopping this holiday    particularly on black friday.  they have  assembled a list of online deals to watch for, as well as a list of online \"duds\" that might not be so attractive.  they like a   inch samsung lcd tv for   ,  at sears and the acer iconia tablet  running android  for    from staples,

low as    on some sites requires a    adapter if you want it to run wi fi.  and this year, bargains may be increasingly creeping in front of potential shoppers via social media. retailers are using their facebook and twitter accounts, among others, to reach out to shoppers.  examples  cvs pharmacy is hosting a quiz on its facebook page, offering a   percent off coupon for people who take it. in addition to listing specials, radioshacks page has a \"so wrong, so right\" contest that lets fans submit a picture of a terrible give for a chance to win a much better one.  and sears is using

physical therapy and rehabilitation will be a four  to six month process.  \"we tested her vision and she did not  like us shining the light in her eyes and wanted to keep them closed, and these are

weakness\" on her right side.  \"in her arm, we are not seeing much tone and we are  not seeing much movement,\" kim said. but he noted that giffords did show movement in her arms during her hospitalization in tucson, so results could change.  \"we really think over the next few months shes going to do remarkably well,\" kim said. \"theres no question that she is aware of what is  happening.\"  giffords is able to move her lips, kim said. \"whether she can mouth words, we will  have to wait and see,\" he added.  portions of giffords\\' skull that were removed are still frozen in a sterile bag, and it could be weeks, if not months, before those portions are surgically returned to her head, doctors said.  \"the transfer of that is not a big deal,\" kim said of such surgery.  giffords has been in intensive care for the past   days since she was shot in the head january   during a meet and greet outside a tucson supermarket. physicians expressed concern friday about

when it accuses hamas of using civilians and their institutions as shields in the ongoing gaza conflict.  the rockets were found in a vacant school between two other united nations . schools being used as shelters for  ,  displaced palestinians, the united nations said. it was the second such discovery at a vacant united nations . school in gaza in a week.  as suggestive as those discoveries are, israels claims that hamas uses civilians as human shields are difficult to prove in an active ground conflict, experts say.  \"it would be impossible at this point to say how much truth there is to the human shield argument,\" said michele dunne of the carnegie endowment for international peace. \"thats not going to be possible to do in the heat of the conflict.\"  it is  a war of perception  possible or not, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu advanced the accusations earlier this week when asked to comment about the brutal conflict, whose death toll has clearly hit palestinians harder.  as of tuesday, at least   palestinians had been killed and nearly  ,  wounded; some    to    of them are civilians, the united nations said. on the israeli side,   soldiers and two civilians have been killed in the same time frame.  measuring such bloodshed is \"very difficult because hamas is using them, palestinians, as human shields,\" netanyahu told cnn. \"we develop anti missile systems to protect, we use anti missile systems to protect our civilians. they use their civilians to protect their missiles. thats the difference.\"  those assertions are significant in the war of perception, which is unfolding in tandem with the conflict between hamas militants and israels military, dunne said.  \"theres many different dimensions of this conflict at the same time,\" dunne said. \"civilian casualties on the palestinian side are very high. that is something hamas can use in the court of public opinion. israel has to have an answer to that  the civilian casualties are so high because of hamas, and this is their answer to that.\"  civic presence complicates things  what complicates the dispute over alleged human shields    an offense against international law    is how hamas is also a political organization embedded in civilian life in the palestinian territory, palestinian leaders say.  \"hamas is a political party after all, not just a military wing. and it has institutions, organizations, homes\" in gaza, said hanan ashrawi, executive committee member of the palestinian liberation organization in the west bank.  that means hamas is more than its military wing, ashrawi said. its members are active in civilian society too.  \"several story buildings were totally demolished and the people living there. how can you claim that hamas is hiding anything in there  these are normal residential areas with no military or any munitions hidden there,\" ashrawi said.  \"the question is that israel is not discriminating, it is destroying the homes of people who are active  in hamas . now \\'active\\' could mean you belong to a social service institution. hamas has day care centers, has schools, has hospitals; it is  a political party as well. it is  a movement.  \"hamas is not just an isolated, you know, sort of armed individuals. it belongs to a very pluralistic system. it has in gaza many services, offices and so on. and therefore if you are going to destroy everything related to hamas as a party, as a movement, it means that you are  going to go on the rampage against families, homes, hospitals, schools and social services,\" ashrawi said.  population plays a factor  the geography and population density of gaza further clouds efforts to determine whether civilian casualties are part of hamas strategy of using human shields or collateral damage from israels ground and aerial assaults, palestinians say.  gaza, with a population of  .  million, is a rectangular tract about   miles long and just a few miles wide, bounded by the mediterranean sea on one side and egypt on another. a border blockade on gaza has been in effect for much of the past seven years. high unemployment and extensive poverty afflict the palestinian territory.  in such a place, it is  difficult for civilians to hide, palestinians said.  \"the population of  gaza        of it is under the age of  ,\" said diana buttu, a human rights attorney who was a legal adviser to palestinian negotiators. \"it is  simply a fact that what the israelis are doing is they are  dropping bombs of a magnitude that we have never seen before on a captive civilian child population.\"  israel said it strives to keep gazans out of harms way by warning them with leaflets, text messages and phone calls in advance of a military strike.  israel blames hamas\\' aggression for putting gazans in danger.  \"they are  putting missile batteries next to hospitals, next to mosques, next to schools,\" said ron dermer, israels ambassador to the united states. \"they are  the ones who are putting their civilians in harms way.  \"they are  saying, \\'ignore the warnings of the  israel defense forces , stay there,\\'\" dermer said.  as a result, civilians can become exposed to an israeli strike.  \"they use the strategy of human shields for a reason because they think it works. they think that israel will be  blamed  for these civilian casualties,\" dermer said. \"hamas should be responsible for the use of human shields.\"  casualties are inevitable  israel has accused hamas of using human shields in previous conflicts in gaza. also, in  , when israel invaded lebanon with the intention of destroying the plo, it accused plo combatants of using civilians as human shields in that conflict, too.  \"the problem with this particular crisis now is that it is  taking place at a time when the whole region from basra in the east, to beirut in the west, from aleppo in the north, to alexandria in the south, is sliding towards hell,\" said hisham melhem, the washington bureau chief for al arabiya news channel. \"thats one of the reasons, by the way, that you do not  see this arab outcry, because the arabs themselves are trying to put out fires in their own countries.\"  one thing is clear about the ongoing warfare between israel and hamas, said retired american . gen. anthony zinni.  fighting in such a confined space as gaza means civilian casualties.  \"it is  so tightly packed,\" zinni said. \"in the end, it is  the poor innocents that are suffering as a result of this.\"  what is hamas\\' endgame in gaza   what is israels endgame in

distribution, despite having been rejected by the american . department of agriculture veterinarian.  corda and cabrera are also alleged to have replaced the heads of sick cows with those of healthy

their eyes locked in a digitally induced trance.  but according to a british occupational psychologist, persistent monitoring of your blackberry will increase stress levels and most likely decrease productivity too.  amir khaki from ak consulting studied the blackberry habits of a group of executives in middle to senior management who were either high or low frequency users.  \"high\" users would typically switch on their blackberry during the commute to work and would keep them on in the evenings and during weekends.  \"low\" users would generally allocate specific times to check their blackberry and respond to emails.  \"people who fell into the high user category tend to have a distorted perception of their own usage and they equate their blackberry use with being dedicated to the job,\" khaki told cnn.  but these displays of enthusiasm did not  translate into efficiency. in one example khaki observed a high frequency user trying to complete a simple spreadsheet. the task, khaki estimates, should have taken about   minutes but ended up taking three times as long because of blackberry monitoring.  the knock on effect of this disruption is the anxiety it creates.  \"you are  not finishing what you are supposed to be doing. the dependency it creates when you ca not  find it, or it buzzes when you ca not  do anything about it because you are in a meeting causes stress,\" he said.  while high users are driven to distraction, their partners are sometimes compelled to destruction.  \"many hated them. i heard a story of one being flushed down the toilet,\" khaki said.  khaki advises companies whose employees have been issued with a smartphone to at least provide a basic level of training.  \"you need to know how to use it properly. after all, we get training when every other technology comes online,\" khaki said.  he suggests companies try to encourage their employees to set a limit on usage. of course, there are going to be exceptions    but on the whole khaki recommends a maximum of   hours use during the working week.  on a personal level, khaki advice is simple  \"at the start of any task, turn it off  interruptions do not  help anyone do anything better, faster or at a higher quality.\"  he added that research suggests people who respond to emails in batches take much less time doing it and are better at it.  with more people upgrading to smartphones, issues over productivity and stress will surely rise as more executives find the line between work and leisure time blurring.  it is  a trend which concerns cary cooper, professor of organizational psychology and health at american  lancaster university management school.  \"we are finding that people are working on their paid work in what used to be their leisure time and thats having consequences both for their health and their productivity,\" cooper told cnn.  \"remember, all these technologies are supposed to be our social support system. but what they have  ended up being is an umbilical cord back to the workplace even in our non work roles in life.  \"i think what is  ended up happening is the technology is managing the people rather than the people managing the technology,\" he added.  cooper believes the recession has perhaps compounded the problem as people feel more job insecure but he urges executives to seize the initiative.  \"the thing that causes people the most stress in life is not having control. use your blackberry rationally. if you are on holiday, access it once every two days, explain to someone that you are away and you will  deal with it when you get back.\"   highlight  executives constantly using their blackberry are less productive says study   highlight  stress levels heightened by overuse, which also feed feelings of

leading to quick, edwards said. and given what they know about quick,  , and the case so far, the virginia state police have announced they suspect foul play.  \"it was so truly out of character ...

  of its   members, reserve members play a significant role in waynesboros police department, according to edwards. like full timers, they hold ranks, have badges and carry firearms.  \"kevin and his family are institutions in the police auxiliary unit,\" edwards said.  quick worked in the reserves while working paying day jobs, including the past   years as a production coordinator for the synthetic fabrics company invista. his position there was eliminated in what edwards called an \"amicable\" separation.  quick was given a severance package of an unknown amount, according to an

least two spots in virginia. the first such match was late friday in fork union, which is located about   miles southeast of charlottesville. on saturday    around when quick should have been at his brothers party    the suv was spotted about   miles north of fork union in manassas, in prince william county.  photographs linked two men to quicks vehicle. one image shows one of the men in a hooded

released so police can talk to him. as of tuesday, police had not, though they had received at least   tips in the case.  rural virginia residents shaken by case  so what happened to kevin quick   according to edwards, authorities have already ruled out the possibility that he disappeared of his own accord.  citing the ongoing investigation, geller from the state police has not  offered much

she told the operating surgeon that she was concerned about leaking silicone from the implants.  so he placed in front of her an implant and sliced it open to show her how the silicone remained solid inside, assuring her it would not spill out into her body. she said it looked like jelly candy.  \"when i was told that there was absolutely no chance of this breast implant leaking because of this \\'jelly baby effect\\', if you like. well, that was about    of the decision because it felt safe and it was guaranteed for   years,\" macintosh told cnn at her home in bournemouth.  \"i did not  think to check the manufacturer ... because it is  not something you do. you go to someone whos supposed to be medically qualified and you trust them,\" she said. \"when you go to a doctor, you do not  say  who makes your medicine  you just assume they are  going to be safe.\"  the manufacturer was pip    the bankrupt french company that appears to have used industrial grade silicone intending for stuffing mattresses inside breast implants. now, there are concerns that pip implants are also more prone to leaking and rupturing.  french authorities announced last month that the government would pay for the removal of the bankrupt companys implants. authorities in france and england have dismissed fears of cancer from the implants, but have said the devices are prone to rupture and could cause inflammation, scarring and fibrosis.  more than   french women have had the implants removed since last year, according to the french government agency that evaluates the safety of medical products. since then, more than  ,  implants have ruptured, the agency said.  germany, uk weigh in on breast implant concerns  months after her surgery, macintosh says she began to get burning and stabbing pains in the area. more recently, she has found a hard mass in one breast. she fears that her pip implants have leaked and she wants them removed and replaced immediately.  \"it is  like a ticking time bomb inside me. until someone says you can have them taken out and put back in again, i am  going to be worried,\" macintosh says.  the problem  who will pay for the operation  britains national health service does not pay for cosmetic surgery, so an estimated    of breast implant operations are done in private clinics.  but now that women are demanding pip implants be removed, some clinics are refusing to treat them.  rowena macintosh says she saved up and paid almost    for her breast implants, including surgery and after care. but the clinic refused to giver her a scan to detect ruptures, she says, and also declined to consider removing and replacing the implants until there was a proven problem.  the clinic refused to comment to cnn citing privacy concerns.  \"i think ultimately it is  the surgeons and the clinics, whoever bought the implants and certified their use, that should be held responsible,\" she says.  the british government agrees, but says there is still no statistical data to show that pip implants are either toxic or more prone to rupturing.  \"our advice remains the same that there is not sufficient evidence to recommend routine removal. we have always recommended that women who are concerned should speak to their surgeon or gp,\" british health secretary andrew lansley in a statement. \"the nhs will support removal of pip implants if, after this consultation, the patient still has concerns and with her doctor she decides that it is right to do so.  \"we believe that private healthcare providers have a moral duty to offer the same service to their patients that we will offer to nhs patients    free information, consultations, scans and removal if necessary,\" lansley said.  but if clinics do not follow through, he added, the national health service will be called upon to step in and support patients. ultimately, taxpayers may have to foot the bill in some cases.  thats not what rowena macintosh wants. she wants the private clinic and surgeon to pay to remove and replace the pip implants as soon as possible, but she realizes that may not happen until after a long legal battle.  she does not  regret the decision to get implants, she says, but she does wish she had chosen a different, more discerning clinic.  \"and to think i have  got mattress silicone inside me and god knows what else they used,\" she

olympic games. but i had to remain in london to help with cnns coverage of the spectacle, and boy was it tough seemingly being in a minority of one.  the singer morrissey reliably poured his usual

theres no doubt that triathlons are harder on the bank balance than other sports, such as running, soccer, baseball or swimming. but believe me when i say that you do not  need to max out your credit card to do triathlon, to enjoy triathlon and even to succeed in triathlon.  in  , i raced my first ironman on a road bike  not the normal tt bike used for ironman racing  with regular wheels. i borrowed my friends race kit, and wore a    pair of sunglasses i bought from a gas station in new zealand three years prior to the race.  the most important investment you can make is in the form of hard work, drive and determination. the most important piece of equipment you can have is a huge heart. the most important weapon in triathlon is your mind.    ways to act like a champion  having said that, it is  hard to compete in a bike ride without a bike. and race directors are not overly keen on your swimming, biking or running in your birthday suit. so here are a few items that every triathlete, budding or otherwise, needs to be able to train and race in this amazing sport   goggles  leaky, ill fitting goggles can cause panic and discomfort. if possible, try goggles on before you buy them. they should stay on your face, even without the strap. your eyelashes should not  touch the lenses, and the nose piece should not  cut you like a knife. slightly tinted goggles are best, as they are suitable for both cloudy and sunny conditions.  wetsuit  wetsuits are mandatory in some races. they help keep you warm and also provide buoyancy. ideally, your wetsuit should be swim/triathlon specific, rather than a surf wetsuit.  you do not  need to spend a fortune    some companies offer one off, monthly or even season rentals. just make sure you swim in the wetsuit before race day and learn how to get it on and off properly. it needs to be snug, but not too tight or restrictive.  swimcap  these are usually provided by race organizers, but a spare is useful for training and for doubling up if the water is cold.  bike  you need one, but what kind  bikes can be few hundred dollars or as much as the price of a car. if you are  just starting triathlon and only planning on doing one or two local events, you can use a beach cruiser, shopper or mountain bike. but if you are thinking of doing more, it is  probably best to buy a road bike    which you can train, race and even commute on.  secondhand bikes can be a great value, but it is  your responsibility to make sure your bike is roadworthy. getting a personal \"bike fit\" from a bike shop is worthwhile.  race day tips from an ironman champ  shoes  whether you use regular or so called clipless pedals  a bit of a misnomer, as you actually clip into them  will depend on your cycling experience and confidence. your choice of pedal determines what shoes you wear. cleated shoes  these lock onto the pedals  are definitely not essential for those new to cycling. with flat pedals you can use the same shoes for cycling and running.  buy a sturdy running shoe that you can trust that suits your form/biomechanics  a good running shop can help with this .  helmet  of course, helmets are a must, but it does not  have to be the all song and dance \"aero\" kind. a regular brain bucket will protect your head fine; just make sure it has passed the necessary safety tests.  race suit  you could wear a pair of shorts and a t shirt under your wetsuit and keep them on until the finish line. but while not essential, opting for a tri suit in a race enables you to wear the same outfit from start to finish. there are basically two options, a single piece tri suit, or a two piece shorts and singlet.  tri training  taking to open water  there are lots of other items that are useful, but not essential, and it is

you may want to add some optional extras or upgrade what you have.  but remember, it is  not all about the gear. it is  about the idea, the plan, the ambition .... the dream.   highlight  champion

books including the biography of late apple boss steve jobs, which he called \"interesting but unfair.\"  these were followed by praise for cinema releases \"we bought a zoo,\" and \"the

kelley blue book offers one of the best online resources to find out how and why your car is worth x amount.  in the case of kelley blue book, they have  vehemently pursued vehicle values for over   years and offer one of the best online resources for companies and private individuals to understand how and why their cars are worth x amount of dollars.  we talked with jack nerad, the executive editorial director and executive market analyst for kbb.com, to explain some of the best ways that you can evaluate your vehicles worth.  do not  fool yourself  surprisingly, one of the problems in properly evaluating a vehicles worth has nothing to do with the vehicle.  think of the computer phrase it guys like to use, \"it is  a picnic error.\" which stands for \"problem in chair not in computer,\" meaning that nothing is really wrong with the computer, the real issue is the person using it. nerad says that some people trick themselves into thinking their vehicle is worth more than it actually is.  \"where we get into difficulty is when people start fooling themselves about the condition of their car    that they believe it is in excellent or pristine condition when actually if it has two or three years on it, it is  going to have some miles on it, some wear and tear.\" aol autos    cars with best blue book values  you may have yelled at your family and friends every time they even considered bringing a coffee cup into the car, but it is  still a used vehicle, uh, i mean pre owned vehicle.  \"even if you have  taken wonderful care of it, it is  not going to be as fresh as it was when it left the showroom    thats something people are going to have to keep in mind.\"  know the true condition  although you have to be honest with yourself about how your car compares with others on the road, taking good care of it can pay off when selling. \"when you have a used car, condition, condition, condition are the three most important things,\" nerad explained. aol autos  best selling sedans  \"so actually assessing your cars condition is crucial to getting the right value, understanding the right value and arriving at the right value. the good news is that at our web site we give you a checklist that you can essentially go through and it includes things like mileage, equipment levels and also an assessment of condition, which helps you arrive at the appropriate value.\"  nerad said that the values kbb gives are estimated ranges of what the vehicle is worth rather than an exact dollar amount because they are factored remotely. still, an estimate from the web site is one of the best and simplest ways to calculate your cars worth. aol autos    best cars of    body shops can help, but a wash and wax might be better  \"most often, it is  been our experience that you are  better off giving an honest discloser of the cars condition and selling it as is opposed to doing things like cosmetic changes, which can be pretty expensive and are kind of in the eye of the beholder,\" nerad said.  aol autos  cars with the worst values  he mentioned that the person purchasing your vehicle might not care as much about some of the minor cosmetic flaws and would rather hold onto their money than pay for a car in pristine condition.  \"i do not  think too many people who are buying used cars, especially over a few years old, are expecting a car to be in perfect condition or even nearly pristine condition. i think they are  expecting to buy something that has a few miles on it in all senses of that term.\" aol autos  car cleaning tips  there is a difference between taking your car to the body shop and taking your car to have a wash and wax job done, however. appearance is still one of your cars best selling points, and you should do everything you can, short of spending more than your cars worth, to make it look good.  \"i think the thing that most helps is appearance. it is  kind of like the curb value of your home. appearance is going to catch peoples eyes, and it is  going to give off the impression that the car was taken care of. if the car is dirty and there are scratches on it, inside and out, if it does not  appear to be taken care of, thats going to have a negative effect on what you are  liable to get for it,\" nerad explained.  \"the good news on that cosmetic stuff, washing the car, giving it a wax job, cleaning the tires, those kind of things are pretty inexpensive to do. even cleaning the interior out helps the added value. it is  certainly worth doing to put your best foot forward that way.\"  understand the resale game  since kelley blue book released its   resale value guide not too long ago, i asked nerad about the assessment of car values. he explained that cars can have high resale values based on their actual resale value, their perceived resale value or simply their demand. the better you understand where your car fits into this system, the easier it will be to understand why your car is worth what is and how to sell it.  \"for instance, a honda, bmw or volkswagen has a reputation for resale value in the marketplace, so it helps them to have good resale value,\" he said. although not necessarily true for the brands just mentioned, nerad notes that sometimes brand equity, the popularity of a particular brand, can override its current level of reliability, although it is  not common.  \"what we have  found though, is there are really no major swings in this, there are changes, year to year changes and we adjust our site year to year, but they do not  really move in a volatile way,\" he said. \"it is  something that has a degree of predictability about it.\"  keep in mind that your cars resale value is public information; anyone can go online and look it up in   minutes. if you let the online experts do their job in evaluating your vehicles worth, you are  likely to sell the vehicle a lot faster than if you overprice it or exaggerate its condition. keep it clean and happy selling.   highlight  expert for kelley blue book explains how to evaluate your cars worth   highlight  people often fool themselves about the condition of the car, expert says

serving sentences for non violent crimes can apply for clemency after the justice department announced new rules wednesday.  deputy attorney general james cole announced that the department would broaden the criteria for clemency, a move that is expected to lead to thousands of prisoners    most serving drug sentences    filing applications to president barack obama seeking to commute their sentences.  the changes are part of a broader effort by the obama administration to modify sentencing laws, allowing for use of rehabilitation and other alternatives to deal with non violent drug offenders and those who previously faced tough mandatory minimum sentences.  attorney general eric holder previewed some of the changes monday by announcing plans to assign more lawyers to handle an anticipated flood of clemency requests.  crack cocaine at heart of once common sentencing disparity  \"we are launching this clemency initiative in order to quickly and effectively identify appropriate candidates, candidates who have a clean prison record, do not present a threat to public safety, and were sentenced under out of date laws that have since been changed, and are no longer seen as appropriate,\" cole said at a news conference.  the clemency changes would be open to prisoners who have met a set of specific conditions  they must be low level, non violent offenders without a significant criminal history and must be serving a federal sentence that would likely be shorter if they were convicted today. they must have served at least   years of their sentence and have demonstrated good conduct in prison, with no history of violence before or during their prison term.  the pending changes are the latest step in an ongoing effort holder calls \"smart on crime,\" which also seeks to remedy the once common wide disparity in sentences handed down over powder versus crack cocaine, based on guidelines first enacted by congress more than   years ago.  earlier  eric holder seeks to cut mandatory minimum drug sentences  of the more than  ,  inmates in the federal prison system, some estimates show the new clemency criteria could apply to about  ,  prisoners. but the number is likely to fall to perhaps hundreds after government lawyers review the applications.  the justice department says it does not  know how many people will end up qualifying because it depends on the applications and how they fit the new criteria. the president has final authority to decide who gets clemency.  obama has been criticized by some civil rights groups for being stingy with his pardons and commutations. but many praised the justice departments decision as a good initial step, including a coalition of groups working on sentencing guidelines.  the announcement \"marks the beginning of the end of the age of mass incarceration,\" said jerry cox, president of the national association of criminal defense lawyers. \"we must seize this historic opportunity to start the process of remedying decades of cruel and united nations ecessarily harsh sentencing policies.\"  cole also announced the appointment of deborah leff to lead the departments office of the pardon attorney, which has come under fire for being slow to review a backlog of applications.  cole said the department was setting up an online application system and working with pro bono attorneys who will assist prisoners in their applications.  mary price, general counsel for the group families against mandatory minimums, which advocates for changes to drug sentencing laws, welcomed coles announcement. \"the doors of the office of the pardon attorney have been closed to petitioners for too long. this announcement signals a truly welcome change; the culture of \\'no\\' that has dominated that office is being transformed,\" she said.  the push to relax sentencing laws has the support of some conservative republican lawmakers, who believe it is a way to reduce spending on federal prisons and to use alternatives to incarceration to deal with drug problems. however, lawmakers want the changes to be made through congress rather than through the presidents executive power.  \"i hope president obama is not seeking to change sentencing policy unilaterally. congress, not the president, has authority to make sentencing policy. he should continue to work with congress rather than once again going it alone, and i am  willing to work with the president on these issues.\" sen. orrin hatch, r utah, said this week.  cole, in his remarks wednesday, said the issue is one of fairness.  \"older, stringent punishments that are out of line with sentences imposed under todays laws erode peoples confidence in our criminal justice system, and i am confident that this initiative will go far to promote the most fundamental of american ideals    equal justice under law,\" cole said.  three years ago, obama signed the fair sentencing act to address the larger issue of drug sentencing disparities. sentencing guidelines provided for a   to   ratio between the penalties for crack cocaine offenses versus those for powdered cocaine, but the fair sentencing law reduced the disparity to   to  .   highlight  rules change is beginning of end of \"mass incarceration,\" advocate says   highlight  the justice department announced new rules for non violent offenders

los angeles county superior court judge yvette palazuelos said in a ruling friday afternoon.  lawyers for aeg live american uccessfully argued that jacksons elderly mother could not sue because she was also supported by daughter janet jackson.  testimony ended friday in the five month long trial, setting the stage for closing arguments to begin tuesday. judge palazuelos will read her instructions to the jury on monday.  jacksons mother and three children contend aeg live is liable in his death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised dr. conrad murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in november   and sentenced to four years in prison.  murray told police he infused jackson with the surgical anesthetic propofol for   nights to treat his insomnia as he prepared for his comeback concerts. the coroner ruled his death on june  ,  , was from a propofol overdose.  aeg live lawyers have argued it was jackson who chose and controlled murray and that their executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments the doctor was giving jackson in the privacy of his bedroom.  the judge cited testimony from katherine jackson and a financial expert hired by aeg live in her partial directed verdict ruling.  the defense expert concluded that the michael jackson paid for the \"bulk\" of his mothers support, including for her home, transportation, food and insurance, the ruling said.  the only evidence aeg live had supporting their defense was katherine jacksons testimony that her youngest daughter, janet jackson, gave her   ,  a month for \"some period of years,\" the judge wrote.  \"there is no evidence that janet jacksons contributions negated katherine jacksons reliance    to some extent    on [michael jacksons] contributions for the necessaries of life,\" palazuelos ruled.  california law does not allow parents to seek wrongful death damages if their offspring had other heirs, unless they can prove they were financially dependent on their child.  the judge is moving the trial to a much larger courtroom in the downtown los angeles courthouse, which will allow more than   people to watch closing arguments.

reasoning for its decision, it backs up a federal appeals court ruling tuesday saying that voting procedures should not  be upended so close to the election.  that decision came in response to a federal judges ruling after a nine day trial that a texas law requiring voters to show photo id at the polls is unconstitutional.  \"the supreme court has repeatedly instructed courts to consider the importance of preserving the status quo on the eve of an election,\" the american . court of appeals for the fifth circuit said.  proponents say the law will help prevent voter fraud. critics say such

in this falls election. continued legal challenges are a certainty, ifill said.  while the courts majority did not  offer any explanation for the ruling, justice ruth bader ginsburg wrote a nearly seven page dissent, joined by justices sonia sotomayor and elena kagan.  ginsburg said the costs associated with the law    obtaining identity cards and the documents needed to get them    are not  as insignificant as backers claim, and argued they harken back to the use of the poll tax in the late  s and early  s as a method of preventing blacks from voting.  \"the greatest threat to public confidence in elections in this case is the prospect of enforcing a purposefully discriminatory law, one that likely imposes an unconstitutional poll tax and risks denying the right to vote to hundreds of thousands of eligible voters,\" ginsburg wrote.  the first day of early voting in texas is monday. voters will choose a new governor to replace outgoing gov. rick perry, new lieutenant

released senate intelligence committees torture report.  around dinner tables and coffee shops in the middle east, north africa and southwest asia, people are probably chuckling over the hype surrounding american . interrogation techniques such as sleep deprivation, loud music, and yes, waterboarding. and what do their own governments use  most likely beatings, mutilations and executions.  the report findings may result in protests, but the most damaging consequence may be that it would set back our intelligence services in fighting terrorism.  those captured on the battlefields of iraq and afghanistan were surprised when the treatment they received by their american . captors was nothing like what they were told by their leaders. they were told they would be brutally tortured and killed regardless of whether they shared information. but they quickly learned that was not  the case.  the mistakes at abu ghraib in   by american upervised night shift wannabe interrogators mirroring what they thought professionals were doing were wrong, and led to the end of the careers of those involved. the good thing that came out of abu ghraib was that despite what americans thought of the american . military, those in iraq knew the american . military would bend over backwards to demonstrate fair treatment.  over time, those who were released told their leaders and american  captors they would rather be detained by the american . than by their own governments. our humane treatment of prisoners resulted in insurgent and terrorist manuals instructing fighters to wait out american detention and that eventually they would be released much like isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi, who was released in   from camp bucca, iraq.  detainees deemed of high value were sent to guantanamo. after reforms following the abuses at abu ghraib they could play chess and backgammon while drinking tea and watching tv via satellite.  at the height of the sectarian fighting in baghdad in  , sunni insurgents and al qaeda took the fight to shia militias. al qaeda leaders were able to mobilize fighters assuring frightened sunnis that american . forces would protect their neighborhoods from shia militias. what  yes, even al qaeda leaders knew the united states    while an adversary    was not the monster they said it was and would do all it could to protect sunni areas from shia militias, and unknowingly freeing up terrorists to go on the offensive.  feigning outrage is being used as a tactic to shift american . public support away from intelligence agencies and law enforcement in order to constrain them in the fight against terrorism. would the easily offended american public condemn those who did everything they could to protect them post  /    sending terrorists back to their own intelligence and security agencies for interrogation or rendition works mainly because they speak the language and know how to use culture and the quran to deconstruct arguments. they may know the tribe and family relations and use that information to exert pressure to denounce terrorism. and yes, they have more leeway to use interrogation techniques. the fear of the known and unknown in rendition can lead to a detainee providing actionable intelligence before employing any tactic and often negates the use of interrogation tactics.  the report states that enhanced interrogation tactics did not provide actionable intelligence    i have to disagree. while some intelligence can be obtained without using these techniques, \"ticking time bomb\" intel cannot be obtained without them. the obama administration is retaining the right to use enhanced interrogation techniques in \"ticking time bomb\" scenarios.  the simple threat of sending a terrorist back to his country of origin was often enough to get him to give up information just to stay in american . custody where he knew he would be treated humanely. he may even have been able to tell someone to \"wake up and pay attention\" like khalid sheikh mohammed did during a lecture to american . intelligence agencies on terrorism.  we are making it too easy for terrorists and their supporters to exploit our media and public over this report, which claims that no actionable intelligence came from these enhanced interrogation techniques. for example, did senate intelligence staffers interview khalid sheikh mohammed  the american . intelligence community were able to gleam valuable and previously unknown information on al qaeda operations and its key leaders from him.  the one advantage interrogators have is the \"fear of the unknown.\" this is often enough to get actionable intelligence from a detainee within the first   hours. the new report takes that away    there is no fear of the \"known.\" in other words, the american . will not do anything to you, you will  be fine and theres no need to give out any information ... and if your food is cold, call sen. dianne feinstein.

'kabul, afghanistan  cnn it is an unimaginably hideous outcome.  to be raped by your cousins husband; be jailed for adultery as your attacker was married; to suffer the ignominy of global uproar about your jailing and assault, but be pardoned by presidential decree; and then to endure the shame and rejection from a conservative society that somehow held you to blame.  the solution in this society  marry your attacker.  thats what happened to gulnaz, who was barely   when she was raped. shes now carrying the third child of her attacker, asadullah, who was convicted and jailed    though this was then reduced.  gulnazs plight    like so much in beleaguered afghanistan    disappeared from the worlds gaze once she was pardoned and released courtesy of a presidential pardon. instead of a new

girl, bouncing around the house that her mother shares with asadullahs first wife    who is also gulnazs cousin.  asadullah agreed to let us speak with him and gulnaz because, it seemed, he wanted to show us that things were now settled, that under afghanistans version of social morality he had done the right thing. he had rescued gulnaz from shame.  \"if i had not  married her,  but  according to our traditions, she could not  have lived back in society,\" he tells us. \"her brothers did not  want to accept her back. now, she does not  have any of those problems.\"     thousands sign petition

household run around the courtyard. the first wife remains american een in the house. a portrait of gulnazs liberator in  , the then president hamid karzai, hangs on the wall. but the sense of order here is undermined by the fact that this is a house built around a crime.  how gulnaz ended up here requires some explanation. there was pressure upon her to marry her attacker after her release. but at the same time, other activists were trying to assist her with an asylum bid abroad.  \"unfortunately, gulnaz was heavily pressured to marry her attacker by various people within the government which, in and of itself, was immensely disappointing,\" her former attorney, an american citizen named kimberley motley, tells us.  \"gulnaz was constantly told that neither she nor her daughter would be protected if she did not succumb to their pressure to marry...  gulnaz essentially became a prisoner of her environment.  \"as an uneducated, young, single mother with no family support, it would have been an uphill battle for gulnaz and her daughter.\"  local pressure won out. she was introduced to her attacker in the shelter where cnn first interviewed her upon release from prison. they talked and it was agreed she would marry him.  most disturbingly, the woman who    despite knowing the stigma it would create around her    defiantly insisted she had been raped when we spoke nearly four years ago, now says she was told by her relatives to make up the allegations.  \"now she is beside me and knows that it was not as big as they had shown it,\" says asadullah.  \"no i am not thinking about it anymore,\" gulnaz adds. \"i do not  have a problem with him now and i do not  want to think about the past problems. my life is ok... i am happy with my life... it is going on.\"  she is then permitted to talk with us alone. asadullah moves away but stands close to the door of the room. though she now maintains she was not raped, she explains her decision. she contradicts her husband, saying her brothers would have taken her back, had she not married him.  \"my brothers opposed the marriage and told me to take my daughter and go to pakistan to live with them instead,\" she says. \"but now we are  married, they disowned me and wo not  see me again.\"  her decision was for her daughter.  \"no, i could not  fulfill my wishes in life. i married this man; i cut relations with my family only to buy my daughters future.\"  it is truly chilling to see how things have gone for gulnaz after the level of international attention her story received    pregnant with the third

lawyers in the trial of michael jacksons doctor are due in court wednesday to discuss removing jurors whose answers they believe should disqualify them from hearing the case.  but legal experts say prosecutors and defense attorneys in the conrad murray trial will be doing more than simply screening jurors based on their answers to the more than   questions filled out on september   and  . they will  also be scrutinizing what prospective jurors may have said outside the courthouse and online about events surrounding the june   death of pop star michael jackson.  \"this is the world of social media, and it directly impacts criminal trials,\" said thomas mesereau, the attorney who successfully defended jackson during his   molestation trial. \"i have no doubt that both sides will hire competent people to explore every aspect of social media to try and find out whatever they can about these jurors, and also to see if these potential jurors have communicated themselves with anyone else about this case.\"  the questionnaire asks whether potential jurors \"ever posted any blogs or posted comments on any internet sites\" and goes on to specifically ask whether the individual \"accessed or posted\" any comments about murray, who is accused of administering a lethal dose of drugs to jackson.  \"i think it is safe to say that contemporary trial practice dictates that you make an effort to find out whatever information you can about jurors,\" los angeles defense attorney shepard kopp said. \"if somebody has a facebook page where the settings are public, and you can see what their interests are, you can very well learn valuable information there.\"  a simple internet search can link attorneys to prospective jurors\\' blogs, tweets and postings on social networking sites to see if they have commented on a specific case. it also may offer insight into jurors\\' psyches.  \"any information you can get on a prospective juror is helpful, because you have such a short period of time in which to evaluate who the person is that is ultimately going to be making a very important decision in the case,\" said richard gabriel, a jury consultant with decision analysis.  gabriel has been advising attorneys for   years on such high profile murder cases as o.j. simpsons and casey anthonys. he says screening jurors today is easier because of the amount of information people share on the internet.  \"if they have a twitter account, it can give you a little bit more about how they interact with the rest of the world, not just in a courtroom setting,\" he said.  but gabriel added that it is rare for a legal team to have time to do such vetting of prospective jurors, because jury selection is completed within hours in a vast majority of trials, not over several weeks as in the anthony case  and most likely murrays as well .  \"the last thing you want to be doing in jury selection is research on your laptop computer in court,\" kopp, the attorney, said about finding time to vet jurors. \"that can send the message to the jurors that you are engaged in some other kind of work and you are not interested enough in the case you are trying.\"  and who knows what the reaction might be if jurors knew they were the ones being judged online    to determine if they were fit to sit in judgment.  opening statements for the trial, which will be

the afghan people, many of whom do not distinguish between american . contractors and the american . military, sen. carl levin, d michigan, said during a senate armed services committee hearing.  a top executive at xe services, the new name for blackwater, acknowledged past mistakes on the part of the companys contractors. he asserted in testimony before the committee that the company is now \"reformed\" and operates \"with a different approach.\"  levin, the chairman of the armed services committee, said that if the united states is going to win the war in afghanistan, \"we need to know that our contractor personnel are adequately screened, supervised, and held accountable    because in the end the afghan people will hold us responsible for their actions.\"  he also warned that \"if we do not  fix the problems of oversight and make sure contractors like blackwater play by the rules and live up to their commitments    we will  be doing a disservice to our troops by making their already difficult and dangerous job even more so.\"  sen. claire mccaskill, d missouri, said the american . mission is experiencing setbacks because of the lack of oversight of military contractors.  \"we have two sets of rules and one image,\" she said. until that changes, \"we are  going to continue to be stalled on progress in terms of accomplishing this mission.\"  the committees top republican, arizona sen. john mccain, agreed with levins and mccaskills assessment.  \"given the stakes and the primary focus of our counterinsurgency strategy to protect the afghan people, we must not tolerate gross misbehavior or criminal misconduct by individual civilian contractor employees,\" mccain said.  \"we cannot afford to tolerate lax oversight by the government entities directly responsible for policing these companies and civilian employees in afghanistan.\"  though more than  ,  contractors operate for a variety of contractors in afghanistan, the senators singled out paravant, a company with \"no meaningful distinction\" from xe services, levin said.  levin cited a december  ,  , shooting at the american . militarys range at camp darulaman during which a paravant program manager carrying an ak   got on the back of a moving car, then shot and wounded a paravant trainer on his team when the car hit a bump, levin said.  though the program manager lost his job, the others on his team who allowed his activities did not, he said.  combined security transition command afghanistan, a multinational military formation that trains the afghan national army, did not appear to have investigated the incident, he said.  had it done so, the american . army \"would have seen that paravant personnel were using weapons improperly and american afely, with inadequate supervision, and that they were carrying weapons that they were not  even supposed to have,\" according to levin.  he also cited a widely reported may  ,  , incident in which two paravant personnel fired their weapons, killing two afghan civilians and wounding a third. the two men have been charged with murder in connection with the shootings.  an army investigation appeared to find that the contract personnel had \"violated alcohol consumption policies, were not authorized to possess weapons, violated use of force rules and violated movement control policies,\" said levin, who cited as his source the man who then led the combined security transition command afghanistan.  paravants contract required it to \"ensure that its personnel ... behave at all times in accordance with the highest professional and ethical standards,\" he added.  records for the two men responsible for the may   shooting show the company failed to properly vet them, levin said. one mans military record \"apparently included assault, insubordinate conduct, absence without leave, failure to obey order or regulation, larceny and wrongful appropriation,\" he said. and his criminal record showed convictions for reckless driving, disturbing the peace, assault and battery, driving while intoxicated, resisting arrest and trespassing.  the other man was cited in a news report for having been discharged from the american . military after being absent without leave for   days and testing positive for cocaine, levin said.  other paravant personnel were fired for alcohol use and drug use, he said.  during his opening statement before the committee, xe services vice president fred roitz acknowledged the companys culpability in the incident.  \"the independent contractors\\' actions that night clearly violated company policies against use of alcohol, unauthorized use of official vehicles, and taking weapons outside the training area,\" he said.  \"those contractors are being held accountable by the law, as they should be.\"  roitz also noted that three individuals involved in the may   shootings had been relieved of their responsibilities prior to the incident.  he conceded, however, that \"paravants policies and procedures were not followed because of failures by paravants prior management.\"  paravants \"leadership reported to me at the time, and i accept my share of the responsibility,\" he said. \"that leadership and company director failed to keep me adequately informed that well established, basic policies and practices were not being followed.\"  roitz, in his statement, told the committee members that \"the new xe services would act differently today. we simply will not send our personnel overseas without a proper authorization for a weapon  where needed  and without full compliance with all requirements.\"  he said the company has \"put in place new leadership and procedures to help ensure this commitment is kept.\"  after the shootings, raytheon, which had subcontracted the work to paravant, accused the company of having failed to properly oversee its personnel.  paravant responded that it would need more money to do that, levin said, calling the companys response \"deeply troubling\" since its contractual obligation already called for that.  in addition, paravant called its personnel \"independent contractors,\" despite \"compelling evidence\" that they were company employees, levin said. that meant that the company withheld no income taxes and paid no social security, medicare, or unemployment tax for them, he said.  the internal revenue service is currently considering paravants classification.  levin also took to task the american . army for \"apparent lack of contractor oversight.\"  before last mays shooting, the army said it had no contracting officer representative in the area, telling the committee that it relied on a dutch contractor to oversee the project. the army said it also monitored the contractors from an office in florida by calling the chief of training and education for the afghan national security forces at combined security transition command afghanistan.  but the chief has told the committee that he did not travel to the training sites to observe paravants personnel, levin said.  on december  ,  , prior to the first shooting incident, raytheon told the army by email that paravant workers had weapons without authority, levin said, but the army \"apparently failed to take action.\"  raytheon issued a statement wednesday in response to the hearing.  \"the contract for these services, including sub contracting support, was addressed through a competitive bidding, evaluation and selection process that involved our customer. paravant employees subsequently violated policies of their contract which led to our termination of the relationship for cause last year.  \"raytheon has been working closely with our customers to enhance controls, procedures and oversight of contractor and subcontractor personnel. we will continue to work with our customers to ensure that strong oversight supports the success of our training services programs,\" the statement said.  a separate report released earlier this month by the inspectors general of the department of defense and the state department criticizes the state department for its oversight of afghan training contracts, specifically a    billion contract to train afghan national police. the state department failed to keep track of the money and materials, including weapons, and failed to prepare the police to fight off insurgents, the report said.  additionally, levin said a key mission of american . forces in afghanistan is to train and equip afghan security forces to take the lead in the war, adding that they use a american . operated facility near kabul to store weapons for the afghan forces.  though no policy exists that allows contractors or subcontractors to use weapons stored at the site, called bunker  , blackwater personnel \"acquired several hundred weapons, including more than   ak  s, from the facility on multiple occasions,\" levin said.  though the company said last june that it had returned them all, levin said that was not the case, citing one ak   that was not returned until late last month.  \"these are weapons that belonged to the afghan national police    not blackwater,\" he said. \"and it is only on the eve of this hearing that the company is giving the majority of them back to the afghan government.\"  levin concluded his opening remarks by saying that the contractors need to understand that they have an impact on how the american . military is perceived.  \"even one irresponsible act by contractor personnel can hurt the mission and put our troops in harms way,\" he said.  cnns charley keyes contributed to this story.   highlight  contractor personnel need to be adequately supervised, senators said   highlight  a top executive

i am  not reaching my full potential for joy. and mind you, it had nothing to do with pippa middleton not returning my calls. because that would be a very strange article for somebody to write.  dateline  atlanta. sad man waits by phone; needs shower.  the article that was actually trending came from livescience, and the premise was that morning people are generally happier than night people. though, as a small victory for us night owls, i would argue that morning people still have to, you know, wake up earlier.  the article cites a study published in the june issue of the journal emotion, which is not to be confused with the journal emoticon that recently sent shock waves through the tech world when it revealed that chronic overuse of smiley faces may cause dysentery.  we are  all going to die.  apparently on the oregon trail.   the research presented in emotion reveals that only    of young adults describe themselves as being morning larks. conversely, by age   most people have lost their affinity for staying up late. basically, it is  leno and then to bed.  but the common thread among both the older and younger subjects was that, regardless of age, morning people responded as being happier. and night people responded as having seen every single episode ever of \"law and order.\"  advantage  night people.  the most interesting finding, however, is that just being awake early and seeing the morning sun is not  what actually makes people happy. even my dog knows that if you get out of bed before, say, noon you are  going to have a bad time. and this is a dog who spends the bulk of his waking hours blissfully licking his crotch.  study researcher renee biss, a graduate student at the university of toronto, said one of the reasons morning people may be happier is because they tend not to suffer from social jet lag. biss said, \"societys expectations are far more organized around a morning type persons schedule.\"  apparently societys expectations do not  include midnight ping pong.  the article suggests hacking your sleep schedule, and biss said, \"one way to do it is to increase your natural light exposure early in the morning.\"  sadly, the light from my iphone does not  count. at least not when i play angry birds in bed. i did, however, find an app called pocket uv light and tested it out on my co worker.  \"do you feel happier \"  \"no.\"  \"what about now \"  \"no.\"  \"what about now \"  \"do not  you ever do work \"  \"no. what about now \"  so that was   cents i will  never see again. still, i was determined to find something that could provide natural light without actually having to get up and face the outside world and/or put on pants.  as always, when times are tough, i turned to skymall.  and thats where i found the optimal light therapy system. for   .  this device delivers \"the optimal  ,  lux of therapeutic light to counteract the effects of fatigue, jet lag, and seasonal affective disorder.\"  i have no idea what a lux is, but i have  always said  ,  is the optimal number. so, this was promising. this was hope. perhaps i had finally found my savior.   current savior  klondike bars.   unfortunately, to reap the benefits of the optimal light therapy system, you have to spend   minutes with your face in front of a blinding, bright light. that, they say, will \"block the release of

britons need to reconsider their reluctance to eat horse meat was \"brave\" and reflects a sad decline in horses\\' value, the head of a horse welfare charity says.  addressing the world horse welfare conference thursday, princess anne    queen elizabeth iis daughter and the organizations president    suggested that making horse meat more valuable might lead to better treatment of the animals.  the olympic equestrian referred to the transport of horses from countries such as poland, the source of some horse meat, saying many horses left looking \"absolutely wonderful\" but suffered in transit.  \"it is  worth noting transport of horses itself is the problem    not the horses or indeed the way they were brought up,\" she said.  \"if thats true then and they value their horses    they look after them well because they are  in the horse meat trade    and it is  the transport thats the problem, should we be considering a real market for horse meat, and would that reduce the number of welfare cases \"  the princess suggested that \"our attitudes to the horse meat trade ... and the value of horse meat might have to change.\"  \"i chuck that out for what it is  worth because i think it needs a debate,\" she said.  she noted that britains attitude to horse meat was not universal. \"as i was reminded, not so long ago, by somebody who would  traveled in france, the most expensive piece of meat in the local butcher was a fillet of horse meat,\" she said.  \"the value of the animal to every individual is slightly different, but if it has real financial value, then you look a little bit further ahead in the way in which you look after your animals.\"  world horse welfare chief executive roly owers said the princess royal had made her point \"within the context of the equine crisis we are  currently in\" when ponies are being sold for as little as ã\\x82â£      .  \"around  ,  horses are currently at risk of abandonment and neglect and charities like ours are struggling to cope as winter approaches,\" owers said in a statement.  \"the economic downturn has driven prices for horses and ponies to rock bottom, and the sad fact is that from a purely economic perspective, they can now be worth more as meat.  \"many in the horse world have known this for a long time. our president has been brave enough to say this openly in hopes of generating a thought provoking debate.\"  overbreeding in britain  the underlying problem, owers told cnn, was the issue of overbreeding in britain. \"there are too many horses and too few homes.\"  owers said he believed anne was caring but also practical.  \"she was not  actually saying, \\'get out there and buy horse meat.\\' she was saying, \\'we should be open to the debate about it    and if the horse goes into the food chain, will it reduce welfare problems \\' \"  owers said the option of sending a horse to a slaughterhouse was one that should be available to people.  \"the issue is not those horses going to an abattoir    it is  not that they are  going to slaughter thats the problem    it is  that they are simply not fit and healthy when they reach there,\" he said.  owers said he knew of people delaying euthanizing horses because they could not  afford the expense to call out a vet and to dispose of a carcass.  emotional issue  britain has a different attitude toward horses than some of its european neighbors, with the idea of eating horse meat an emotional one, he said.  \"on the continent they are viewed as farm animals to a far greater degree; here they are seen as pets, leisure or sport animals.\"  the debate would be different if horses were regarded in the same light as pigs, sheep or cows, he said.  \"as a country we have eaten horse meat in the past    we did in the second world war, but you could argue that it was a time of crisis,\" owers said.  britains royal society for the protection and care of animals said it welcomed any debate on horse welfare issues.  \"our centers, and those of other charities, are overflowing with horses which have been abandoned, neglected and abused, and we are struggling to keep up with the demands for our help,\" it said in a statement.  \"the killing of horses for meat is an emotive subject as many see them as companion animals rather than a food source, a sentiment the rspca has great sympathy with.  \"however, the societys primary concern for all animals killed for meat and otherwise is that they are cared for, handled and transported in a way which safeguards their welfare at all times.\"   highlight  princess

said, before adding that he had acted \"very naively and very stupidly\" in some of his dealings with his former colleague.  the prosecution claimed much of the money was promptly laundered by pages

in her book, referring to her visit to the american  arizona memorial in pearl harbor, after she compares the combination of foods she was eating for lunch to the ethnic variety of the current hawaiian citizens.  she acts like a tour guide on a trip through time    stopping at this place and that in hawaii to expound on historical events    often flavoring the accounts with personal anecdotes or wry comments.  when writing about hawaiian royals in   dropping one taboo on what women could eat, she notes, \"as a female carnivore, i am  delighted that half the population was freed to eat pork.\"  exploring american . history in a very chatty tone and with personal asides has put several of vowells books on bestseller lists. in \"assassination vacation,\" she dipped into the times of political violence that claimed the lives of american . presidents abraham lincoln, james garfield and william mckinley. in \"wordy shipmates\" she wrote about the english puritans that settled the massachusetts bay colony.  the author, essayist and frequent public radio commentator can hold her own against the quick wits of tv political satirists john stewart and stephen colbert as she proved on her latest book tour.  with her writing, vowell says she aims to put a human face on the people from the past. she describes the bloody tactics that kamehameha the great used to end more than a century of warfare and establish the hawaiian monarchy in  .  like a tourist she also details how her   year old nephew twists his underwear into a loincloth and performs \"an amusing if insensitive impression\" of the warrior.  vowell finds the pluck of the new england missionaries admirable for their willingness at barely   years old to leave home, family and country to sail to \"the most isolated island chain in the world\" aboard a ship \"so crappy it made the mayflower look like the qe .\"  but their mission to convert the heathens to christianity does not impress the self described godless heathen author. she opines \"theres not much difference between jehovah and ku  except that once a year the hawaiian god of war actually takes time off .\"  vowell describes the native hula dances    including one that is accompanied by chants praising the genitals of the king    as part of an \"academic nearly religious spiritual tradition that is incredibly rigorous.\"  there are so many rules on behavior, land management, fishing and other areas that vowell describes the hawaiian culture as very conservative. so to her, the disagreements between the missionaries and the hawaiians about what was proper behavior, \"was like watching two kind of conservative traditions squaring off.\"  she admits that she especially likes writing about historical characters that she did not  like    including a man who faked being a mormon leader as he american uccessfully plotted to establish his own pacific empire.  but one of her favorite scenes to write about was the funeral procession of king liholiho who had died along with his wife from measles during a trip to visit king george iv in england in  .  their bodies were returned to hawaii aboard a british royal navy frigate commanded by the seventh lord byron, a cousin of the late poet.  vowell describes a \"fantastical scene\" of all these people participating in a procession through honolulu  hawaiian royals in western clothes, nine other hawaiians in yellow feathered war cloaks, british royal navy officers in their uniforms and the missionaries in their black wool outfits. and then there were native hawaiian guards who were wearing a variety of western garb   but who apparently did not  understand the need for pants.  vowell says the changes in the years that followed mostly had a negative impact on the hawaiian people. much of their land fell into the hands of the sugar plantation owners, the descendants of the missionaries overthrew hawaiis last monarch and despite the natives\\' petitions

round of the countrys presidential elections thrust the far right into the headlines.  a day later in the netherlands, the refusal of the far right freedom party to back austerity measures led the dutch government to collapse.  two very different scenarios, but with a common thread  the efforts of extremist parties to win support by plugging into popular discontent over the financial crisis, against the backdrop of a wider social unease and anti immigrant sentiment.  across europe, anger at a perceived mismanagement of the economic crisis, and accompanying high unemployment, low growth and painful cuts, has seen the fall of half a dozen governments.  ireland, portugal, spain, greece, finland and italy are among them    and unless president nicolas sarkozy pulls a victory out of the bag in the second round of voting on may  , france may be the next to see power change hands, this time in a shift to the left.  sarkozy, for his part, says he will keep an open ear to the concerns of the national front party, led by marine le pen    but rejected any notion of striking a deal with the far right group.  \"there will be no pact with the national front, there will be no national front ministers, but i refuse to demonize the men and women who in voting for marine le pen expressed a crisis vote, a vote of anger, a vote of suffering and a vote of despair,\" he said on french radio wednesday. \"i have to take their message into account, i have to listen to them, i have to hear them and not hold my nose.\"  even so, will the regions economic insecurity translate into greater gains for the far right   europes far right parties are definitely seeing a resurgence, according to dr. matthew feldman, director of the radicalism and new media research group at the university of northampton, but the austerity crisis is only one part of the picture.  he says the far right movement has been gaining ground for years, thanks partly to efforts to revamp its previously overtly racist and fascist image.  this does not  mean that those racist or nazi sympathizing elements do not  still exist within different countries\\' far right groups, he said, but those at the top have often learned to present a more acceptable public face.  instead of open racial attacks, they play up a threat to national identity and criticize multiculturalism, feldman said.  on the campaign trail, national front leader marine le pen called for france to leave the eurozone and restore its own currency, the franc, as well as criticizing its political integration into the european union.  but her rhetoric also drew on an anti immigrant, anti muslim sentiment that has deep roots in france and elsewhere.  a report by rights group amnesty international released monday highlighted the issue, saying muslims in europe face discrimination in education, employment and religious freedom.  this discourse was likely a factor in sarkozy turning the labeling of halal meat into an election issue, in a bid to win far right supporters from le pen.  dr. michael minkenberg, a professor of political science at the european university viadrina in frankfurt  oder  who has also taught at new york, cornell and columbia universities, said concern over immigration, law and order \"and the feeling that things are not  what they used to be any more\" are at the heart of support for europes radical right.  euroscepticism, as resistance to greater european political integration is known, is also on the increase, he said, and \"theres this anxiety about what will happen, a growing complexity and not much reassurance from either national governments or the european union.\"  coupled with a mistrust of the political elite, this has also led to a swell of support for the far right in austria, belgium and scandinavian countries, minkenberg said.  despite that trend, analysts caution against drawing sweeping conclusions from the far rights success in france.  the national front has been well entrenched in frances political life for decades, under jean marie le pen before his daughter marine took charge last year, said thomas klau, of the european council on foreign relations.  as such, its achievement in taking a fifth of the votes in sundays election, while notable, does not indicate a sudden rise to prominence for the far right, he said.  socialist francois hollande, who is favored to win on may  , told frances daily liberation newspaper that he saw the strong showing for the national front as an expression of peoples \"social anger\" rather than a firm adherence to the partys more extremist views.  it revealed a discontent particularly in rural areas and among working class voters, he said, with many feeling abandoned by the government. his job will be to persuade them that his left wing party will listen to and answer their concerns, he said.  klau argued that a feature of recent ballots in europe has been the readiness of voters to change their governments without turning to the political extremes, pointing to spains election last november as an example.  \"voters have been single minded across the eurozone in terms of expressing their dissatisfaction at how the crisis has been run by the government in charge, whatever their political hue,\" he said. \"but at the same time, they have sufficient confidence in their own political system to replace their governments with the mainstream political opposition.\"  if the major parties can convince voters that they hear their concerns, they are less likely to turn to the extremes of left or right, said minkenberg.  but sarkozys failure to deliver on his promises on immigration during five years in power has undermined his support from the right wing electorate despite his attempt to appeal to them in campaigning, minkenberg said.  in the netherlands, klau said the impact of dutch politician geert wilders\\' decision to withdraw his freedom partys support for the government, triggering its collapse, will have only a temporary destabilizing effect.  the economy will be central to the election of a new government, but the far right does not attract the same level of support as in france.  wilders, who wants a referendum on the euro, preferred to exit the coalition than lose political credibility by backing the painful cuts demanded by europe, said dr. kostas gemenis, at the university of twente in the netherlands.  outgoing prime minister mark rutte urged lawmakers to act responsibly. \"the economy is stalling; unemployment is threatening to rise; and the national debt is growing more quickly than we can afford. these are the facts, and we cannot ignore them,\" he said tuesday.  debt ridden greece also faces an election on may   that hinges on the economy.  the situation is very fluid there, but the far right laos party, with a couple of lawmakers in parliament, has lost ground to the ultranationalist golden dawn party, which has a history of street violence, gemenis said.  opinion polls suggest golden dawn may pass the threshold of    of the vote, which could give the party eight or nine mps in a parliament of  , he said.  \"they wo not  be able to make any difference, but it is  a very strong message when people vote for such an extreme party,\" he said.  at the moment, the most likely outcome is another coalition between the two main parties, gemenis said. but if the radical groups manage to tie anger over the austerity measures mandated under the countrys international bailout to a sense of nationalism, they might pick up more disaffected voters.  so, does the far right present a broader threat to european freedoms   how extreme the anti immigration debate becomes depends very much on the individual country, minkenberg said.  farther east, a different strand of far right thinking dominates in countries like poland, hungary, bulgaria and romania, he said. there, far right groups poll around    but tend to be more nationalistic in tone, he said, with anti semitism and anti roma views seen as more legitimate there than elsewhere in europe.  feldman highlights the far rights recent apparent moves to establish a pan european cultural movement as the biggest risk.  far right groups from scandinavia, the united kingdom, germany and eastern europe gathered last month in the danish city of aarhus for what they said was a rally to make their governments aware of the threat of islamic extremism.  although it was dwarfed by a left wing counterdemonstration, the protest was significant as an attempt by the far right groups to create a common trajectory, he said. what remains to be seen is how much traction their extreme views can gain.  \"it is  clear that a large minority across europe is not  comfortable with these things, demographic change and multiculturalism,\" feldman said. \"but what the far right offers is not something that many can accept.\"   highlight  frances national front gained    of

teenagers, with one in three teens sending more than   texts a day, a new survey says.  the survey by the pew research centers internet   american life project illustrates the indispensable role that text messaging, and mobile phones in general, play in the lives of todays teenagers.  three quarters of    to   year olds own cell phones, up from   percent in  , and daily text messaging to friends has increased rapidly in recent years.  the research, made public tuesday, confirms that teens make and receive far fewer phone calls than text messages. they primarily use their phones for voice calling when communicating with parents, although they prefer text messaging when it comes to communicating with their peers.  although teens make or receive about five calls a day, half of them send a minimum of   text messages a day, the survey found.  \"texting is so functional and efficient,\" said amanda lenhart, a senior research specialist at pew, when asked to explain the survey results. \"it is  convenient and fits into those small spaces in daily life. you are  not talking about much, but you are  telling people you are  connected to them.\"  how do teens manage to send so many text messages while spending the better part of monday through friday in the classroom   forty three percent of teens who take their phones to school reported sending at least one text message from class a day, despite the fact that many schools have banned cell phones in class.  lenhart said this just goes to show how important text messaging is to teens.  \"teenagers have been looking for ways to skirt around rules and defy administrators for millennia, whether it is  passing notes in class or passing digital notes in class through cell phones,\" she said.  and teenage girls are doing most of the texting. girls send and receive about   text messages a day, while boys send and receive only  .  this is not a surprising find, according to pew, as females also use other communicative tools more than males. girls will text for social reasons more so than boys will, the survey found. for example,   percent of girls text their friends multiple times a day \"just to say hello,\" as opposed to   percent of boys who do the same.  the fact that girls use their cell phones more than boys might be one reason that of the   percent of parents who have monitored their teens\\' cell phones, the vast majority are parents of    to   year old girls.  \"it is  a historic relationship. ... parents tend to regulate girls more than boys for a variety of social and gender reasons,\" lenhart said.  teens are using their phones to record and share their daily experiences, lenhart said. in addition to texting,   percent of teens use their mobile phones to take pictures, and   percent of teens share their pictures with others.  during focus groups, lenhart said, she asked teens what they liked to take pictures of with their cell phones. the most common answers  their pets, the people in their lives and the funny things they want to share with their friends.  lenhart said the growth of wireless carriers\\' unlimited texting plans has made it easier for teens to communicate via text

in  . a bystander could easily look at their naturally pretty faces and fit bodies and assume  \"these are the popular girls. surely they have  never been insulted or ignored, certainly never had to deal with being bullied.\" they would  be wrong.  \"the two of us have really personal experiences with what we call girl against girl crime,\" says parsekian, who co founded the nonprofit organization kind campaign with thompson in   to try to stop this pattern of harassment.  as she elaborates on a past where middle school became torture, filled with flying rumors and drama that led to an eating disorder and a seventh grade suicide attempt, the cliche \"never judge a book by its cover\" comes to mind.  for thompson, her experience with the brutality of \"girl world\" came in her junior year of high school when a former friend started spreading rumors about her.  \"i feel so lucky to be able to travel all over the country and talk to girls and boys about some of these really dark times that we find ourselves in,\" says thompson. \"letting them know that there is hope and that together we can change.\"  that spirit of transformation through kindness is the driving force behind their nonprofit and the documentary \"finding kind,\" which the two produced in  . in the film, the two friends drive across the country interviewing hundreds of women and discuss how females treat one another.  \"the message that we are  trying to get across is to not only have a really honest dialogue about the really damaging effects of broken relationships between females, but really figuring out why it is that girls are so competitive and hard on one another rather than seeing each other as allies,\" says parsekian.  as representatives of kind campaign, both have dedicated the past four years of their lives to addressing this aspect of bullying. through their movie, they begin to facilitate honest conversation between girls and women of all ages. they follow that presentation with two interactive features  the kind pledge and kind apologies.  a pledge requires students to declare an action step they can take toward being kinder to their peers.  both women say, though, it is  the kind apology where progress lies. in this exercise, girls ask for forgiveness from those they have  hurt for the things they have  said or done.  thompson saw firsthand how much a sincere apology can mend relationships. \"the very last day of school the girl who started the rumors and turned all my friends against me had the courage to apologize to me for what she had done. and i think her apology really helped me to be able to take that in and forgive her and move on,\" she says.  as october is bullying awareness month, the women recently left for their fourth nationwide tour of schools. they say it will be their last journey. they are currently in production on a \"kind kit\" which will include a recorded version of their school assembly program, the film \"finding kind,\" and a yearlong curriculum they say is endorsed by self esteem expert and author jessica weiner  who also appears in the documentary .  parsekian says this packaged material will reach hundreds more schools than the pair could by traveling to one school at a time. reflecting on her personal journey through this issue of girl on girl bullying, the filmmaker highlights the message of \"kind campaign\"   \"we are  not standing here pointing the finger and saying, \\'you are  a mean girl and this is what you are  doing wrong,\\' because at the end of the day, every person has been on both sides of this, and we have  all thought things or done things that we should not  have that have hurt other people in our lives. it is  really about pointing the finger at ourselves and realizing that

cnn     \"sitting in class, second grade, teachers would put me outside the hallway because i had been ticking so loud i was a  would istraction,\\'\" recalled   year old amber comfort. \"teachers would walk by me back and forth and say \\'you would  better stop that before you get into my class next year.\\' things that were just completely obscene, that you would never expect the world to be, and i had to deal with on a daily basis.\"  from the age of five, comfort has suffered from tourettes syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes her to make involuntary movements and loud noises, known as tics.  for almost   years, the condition has shaped every moment of her life. \"i do not  remember any parts of ever being tic free,\" she said. \"theres not a day thats gone by that i do not  remember moving or making noise when i could not  help it.\"  but she has not let tourettes dictate how she lives. comfort graduated from high school with honors and was even accepted to college on full scholarship. but her uncontrollable outbursts have made it hard to continue her education or even hold down a steady job.  there is one thing that comes easy though. singing. she loves to sing, and when she does, her tics are curiously absent.  \"singing is what gets me through a lot of hard days. when i am  on the computer, when i am  driving, when i write poetry, basically anything with a sense of focus,\" comfort explained. \"when i have to worry about my tics i do just that    i worry about my tics.\"  deep brain stimulation  there is no cure for tourettes syndrome. but after years of suffering and american uccessful therapies, comfort was selected for experimental surgery by specialists from the university of floridas center for movement disorders.  the procedure is called deep brain stimulation  dbs , where small electrodes are implanted into the brain to stimulate affected regions in patients with movement disorders such as parkinsons disease or tremors.  the delivery of electricity is at the root of what makes dbs work. the electrodes are attached to an impulse generator, or pacemaker, implanted under the patients skin, which provides electrical impulses to the affected region of the brain.  by providing impulses to circuits in the brain associated with a specific motor skill, it is  possible to change the connections between neurons and stop the abnormal activity that causes the symptoms.  dbs was first approved for tremors in   and since then more than  ,  patients have had the procedure. but comforts surgery would be the first time the technique had been used for tourettes.  tourettes syndrome is characterized by an impulsivity that combines both emotion and motor activity and makes the underlying neurology differ from that of parkinsons and other conditions previously treated with dbs. \"the difference in tourette is the movement is not  there all the time,\" explained neurologist dr. michael okun, co director of the center for movement disorders and author of \"parkinsons treatment    secrets to a happier life with parkinsons disease.\"  \"the patients that have a tic, they get this build up; they call it a premonitory urge. they feel like they need to move and until they move, they do not  feel better.\"  this urge to tic is a daily woe for people like comfort. \"it is  like having   mosquito bites that you ca not  itch,\" she said. \"theres no way to ever tell they are coming.\"  until now, treatments available for tourettes have been behavioral therapy and drug medications. these treatments, however, only manage the severity of tics to make them less disruptive and do not prevent them. \"without my medications, i am one of the worst cases the doctors have ever seen in the united states,\" said comfort.  experimental surgery  in september  , comfort had the dbs electrodes implanted in her brain    a   hour process that involved six operations. in addition to the standard electrode leads, she had a new grid like device implanted on top of her brain    an experimental procedure intended to gather information from her brain that could not only lessen her tics, but maybe someday stop them.  not only did comfort have four holes drilled into her skull, but she was awake throughout the process. \"the way sedatives work is by suppressing brain activity, so we get better recordings if we do not  use any sedatives,\" explained dr. kelly foote, also co director of the center for movement disorders, who performed the surgery.  the team uses music to help relax the patient while the painless, but stressful, procedure is carried out. \"we let them pick the music to take the focus off the fact that i am drilling a hole in their head, and cutting their scalp and that sort of thing,\" said foote.  comforts surgery was a success, but implanting the stimulation and recording devices is just the start of the dbs process. okun and foote will now monitor comforts brain activity over the next six to   months. the grid will provide insight into the underlying cause of her tourettes syndrome and allow the doctors to regulate the electrical impulses so that they can begin to manage and maybe someday, eliminate her tics.  for comfort, this is her chance to finally live a normal life.  \"if it is  a chance to change my life for the better and to make sure i do not  have to deal with this anymore, i am  up for it,\" said comfort. \"i have had this   years, and i think i have  done my time.\"   highlight  tourette syndrome causes sufferers to make involuntary movements and noises   highlight  deep

have difficulties with many simple tasks, but they can speak.  humans are so tuned to words that from about the age of   months, children learn about eight to   new words a day, a rate that continues until adolescence.  humans love to speak  when two hearing people encounter each other, they will speak, despite having other means of communication such as gesturing or drawing. even when people speak different languages or come from different cultures, they will try to find common words and phrases.  one day old infants can distinguish speech from any other sounds and   day olds can distinguish between their native language and other languages. even in the womb, a fetus can distinguish her or his mothers voice from all other female voices. adults can distinguish speech sounds at twice the rate of any other sounds, aided by special hair cells in the outer right ear.  see also  florida anthropologist explains \\'baby talk\\' origins  among all animals, only humans have the necessary breathing apparatus and musculature to be able to speak  despite the \"planet of the apes,\" no primate could speak like a person, even if their brains grew. even human ancestors such as the neanderthal could not possibly speak  speech is a new and remarkably impressive ability.  so, there is nothing so human as speech    at least until modern technologies came along. through striking advances in a computers ability to understand and produce speech, it is common to use your telephone to make airline reservations, answer questions and search the web.  because of the shrinking size and increasing speed of computers, it is also possible to speak directly to your automobile.  from putting up with the car intoning, \"your door is ajar,\" we have moved to navigation systems that can tell you where to find a latte and car interfaces that understand spoken commands and even allow drivers to dictate emails, texts and make phone calls.  what could be more simple and natural than talking, even to a technology  and speaking to cars seems particularly desirable. we do not  have to take our eyes from the road or our hands from the wheel to select buttons or make choices  why not let our mouths and our ears do all the work   unfortunately, it is  not so simple or so desirable.  recent research by the aaa foundation for traffic safety, conducted by david strayer at the university of utah, finds that the new technology can be so distracting it impairs the ability to drive. studies found that while driving, our attention becomes overloaded by speaking. it basically takes our minds, if not our eyes, off the road.  here are three reasons why talking while driving is so distracting, and not as safe and effective as you might think   people like to picture who they are talking with. when you speak with someone face to face, you \"hear lips and see voices\"  your brain automatically and easily focuses on the person.  when you speak on the telephone, you use brainpower to create a mental image of the person you are talking with  the less you know the person, the more mental workload it takes. when you talk to a car, use a phone in a car or dictate a text message, your brain has to do a great deal of work to picture with whom you are communicating. when you are  thinking that hard, it is  very difficult to pay attention to the road.  thats why talking on a cell phone    hands free or not    is much more dangerous than talking to a passenger. the need to imagine steals from attention to the road.  see also  is hands free driving just as dangerous   people want to be understood. although people love to speak, there are few more frustrating things than someone not listening. listeners puts a great deal of energy into showing that they are listening  they nod their head, say \"uh huh,\" open their eyes and change their posture. people are built to expect these signals of attention, but cars refuse to provide them.  as a result, drivers become overly concerned with whether the car understands or is even listening, and their attention is again drawn away from the road. in addition, the voice of the car does not have the rich vocal cues that indicate engagement and emotion, providing further evidence that the car is not  understanding.  cars are not native speakers. when you encounter someone who is not  facile in your language, you have to put a great deal of time into selecting the right words, avoiding idioms and speaking slowly and clearly. speech is no longer an easy and natural means of communication in these instances.  while it is remarkable that cars can understand something that took billions of years of human evolution, the typical car recognition rate of    to    makes it a mediocre second language speaker. as a result, speech becomes effortful and demanding, stealing attention from the road.  because of these problems, my laboratory and laboratories around the world are trying to find ways to support the driver in creating mental images, in showing that the car wants to understand and enabling the car to understand at levels equal to or even better than a person.  and soon cars will be driving themselves, so that people can ignore the road and multitask their way to fighting for attention from each other, just as they do outside the car.  watch  the self driving car changes everything  the

feels so much better having done the yoga.  \"i still get the odd hamstring strain, which you are going to get playing football, but it was not  about curing the problem, but making it less frequent. i wish i had done it from the start of my career.\"  at an age where most players have long since hung up their boots,   days on from his first united appearance as a substitute in a     defeat by everton, giggs is demonstrating rare longevity.  \"ryan is obviously a different player now compared to when he broke through as a   year old winger,\" henning berg, who played alongside giggs at

excellent.  \"i think, when you get to ryans age, it is  best to make decisions at the end of the season. it is  how you feel, how you have  done over the year and what your body is telling you.  \"theres no quick decisions on that one. hes on the staff now, so we can always use him at any time \"  giggs also credits his continued influence and fitness to spending his entire career at one club, avoiding the upheaval which can accompany numerous transfers.  \"if i would  moved from club to club i would  be finished by now,\" giggs said after his virtuoso performance in leverkusen.  \"i

as it used to, but it continues to infect tens of thousands in our country each year. and, unfortunately, some groups in the united states are being affected at the kinds of rates you would expect to see in hard hit developing countries.  national black hiv/aids awareness day, being marked saturday, is a good moment to reignite the conversation over a crisis that should have ended years ago.  despite representing only    of the american . population, african americans account for nearly half of all new hiv infections each year. true, the impact of hiv varies across the black community    hiv infection rates have declined among injection drug users, black women, and black infants born to seropositive mothers. and new hiv infections among black heterosexual men are stable.  but the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  has recorded a troubling spike in new hiv infections among black gay and bisexual men. black gay men have been the only black population in which new hiv cases have been growing since  . indeed, the cdc estimates that one in three black gay men in major american . cities is hiv positive.  hiv deaths among african americans drop   , cdc says  meanwhile, although hiv rates have declined among black women and black injection drug users, there are regions of the country where mortality among hiv positive black women exceed other populations, while viral suppression, a goal of hiv medication that limits transmissibility to others and often ensures a long and healthy life, continues to remain elusive for many injection drug users.  a common misconception about the higher prevalence of hiv among black people is that it is caused by engaging in more risk associated behaviors. several studies demonstrate that black americans do not necessarily engage in more high risk behaviors than others.  so why are black communities typically disproportionately affected   a new report released by the foundation for aids research tries to shed some light on this issue, and why the disparities have deepened over time. a close examination of the epidemic within the black population is important because it will mean that we are better equipped to fight hiv/aids in america through better understanding how racial discrimination, poverty, lack of access to health care and other socioeconomic factors contribute to the disproportionate burden of hiv among black americans.  given the fact that a substantial number of black americans are uninsured or underinsured, the affordable care act has been a crucial policy development for black americans living with or at risk for hiv. historically, many people with hiv were barred from accessing health care services.  now, health insurance programs expanded under the aca are prohibited from denying coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions.  further, certain preventive services, such as routine hiv screening, must be provided at no cost to the beneficiary.  and all plans must provide treatment. this is especially beneficial is tackling the problem as early hiv treatment has been found to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to other partners by   percent.  but obstacles remain in delivering health care to black americans with hiv. for example, an essential tool to fight hiv and racial health disparities is medicaid, the single largest source of coverage for people with hiv in the united states. however, a supreme court decision ruled that medicaid expansion under the aca can only be available to uninsured people living in states that choose to implement it.  unfortunately, about   states have opted out. in these states, an estimated  .  million uninsured americans who would have qualified for full medicaid coverage will most likely remain uninsured. black americans living in those states are twice as likely to be uninsured and more than six times as likely to have hiv. this is most notably the case in the deep south, where nine states with high rates of hiv/aids diagnoses have opted not to expand medicaid.  focusing on populations at highest risk for hiv    especially black gay men    must also be a priority. \"when new infections among young black gay men increase by nearly   percent in three years, we need to show more that their lives matter,\" said president barack obama during a world aids day address in  .  this mandate was heard, and notable efforts are now underway across various federal agencies to better address hiv among black gay men.  one encouraging sign has been the way the private sector has responded. for example, a multi million dollar initiative was just announced by viiv healthcare to address the hiv epidemic among black gay and other men who have sex with men in baltimore, maryland, and jackson, mississippi, two american . cities hit hard by hiv/aids.  but more must be done.  one thing that should be the focus of policymakers is ensuring that we prioritize and dedicate resources to boost treatment and prevention programs targeting black gay men, and improve care for hiv positive black women and injection drug users  we should also expand our education and awareness initiatives to diminish the stigma and discrimination that prevent too many people from seeking hiv testing, prevention and treatment services. and finally, we can do more to ensure proper access to health care for millions of americans living in poverty and deliver essential care to people with hiv, and help prevent its spread.  closing the gap on racial disparities in the hiv/aids epidemic in the united states will require that we confront the underlying factors that fuel the epidemic among black americans and tackle them head on, with the urgency they deserve.   highlight  saturday is national black

them in their workplaces to be taken seriously, \" said rebecca arnold, professor of fashion history at londons courtauld institute of art.  \"i think womens work wear is more to do with being mentally comfortable, fitting in, and being seen as respectable.\"  of course each workplace is different. as arnold says  \"someone whos a lawyer is going to dress in a very different way from someone working in a shop.\"  working it  gaze across some of the most popular workplace fashions of the last   years, and they often act as a mirror to much bigger social trends.  \"what you see from the  s onwards, is this negotiating of public space    using dress to visualize the way women are seen at work, and how they want to be seen,\" said arnold.  \"in the  s you had lots of debates around what women should wear to be feminist and still be taken seriously. some really felt you should wear trousers and others thought that was wrong because it was being seen as a man.\"  and just because it is  workplace fashion, does not  mean it has to be fashionable.  \"we have  still got shirts that look like mens shirts, we have  still got suits based on mens fitting,\" said arnold. \"workplace fashion does not  move quite as fast as fashion itself.\"  by women, for women  then theres the female designers who helped redefine womens wear in the modern age. from coco chanels suit dress in the

chinese dissident chen guangchengs daring and extraordinary escape to the american . embassy in beijing has captivated the world. at first, it appeared that american . diplomats and the chinese government brokered a deal that satisfied chen and everyone involved. but now chen says he wants to leave china, and that he feels american afe.  has the obama administration bungled his case  did president barack obama use people who were capable of correctly interpreting the signals in china  or was there a gap in translation   possible breakthrough for blind activist  we learned earlier this week that chen was released from the american . embassy with the chinese governments assurance of his \"safety\" and a promise to facilitate his study of law in an american pecified place outside his home province of shandong. it sounded like a win win solution. but those who have intimate knowledge of china and its political system had reasons to worry.  in many ways, the deal was almost made to be broken, because it was based on three erroneous assumptions on the part of american officials.  the first false assumption is that the chinese governments assurances are ironclad. to be sure, there has to be some trust among negotiators. but the chinese government has meted out overly harsh treatment to dissidents in recent years. what confidence do we have that it will make an exception in chens case  the american trust that the chinese government will honor its promises was misplaced, if not outright naã\\x83â¯ve.  behind the scenes of the chen drama  second, american . officials assumed the word \"safety\" means the same thing for both sides. the chinese negotiators may have had a totally different arrangement in mind when they spoke of safety. for them, chen was \"safe\" when he was confined in his home in shandong, surrounded by armies of security guards.  third, the united states should not have thought of the case as just zealous local shandong officials abusing their power when they confined chen. it is hard to believe that shandong officials did what they did to chen, a high profile activist, without consent from above. that local officials from elsewhere will not abuse their power is hard to believe. would chen not be viewed as a threat to \"stability\" by his handlers once he enters a chinese university   some china observers have pointed out that chen can only blame himself for insisting to stay in china as a cornerstone of the deal. they are disappointed by his change of mind. chen certainly knows the chinese political system the best among those involved in the negotiation. so he should have expected the threats he may face if he stays in china.  but, for a blind and ill person who had just escaped from a long detention with little contact with the outside world, is not  it too much to ask that he make the most rational decision  and how could he opt to leave china when his family was in the hands of chinese officials who could have caused them harm   there is no easy fix to the predicament. taking chen out of china would have been a good solution, but that possibility may be receding.  the american . officials who were involved with the negotiations should have recognized the potential problems in the deal and expected the treatment that chen would encounter after leaving the american . embassy. if they are not well equipped to do so  despite the fact that some of them are ethnically asian , then where are their china hands   while we do not  know how the chen case will ultimately turn out, for the united states, it is  time to think strategically of enlisting more advisers from a new generation of china scholars. there are political scientists teaching at elite universities in the united states who are more than qualified to advise the state department on sensitive diplomatic issues. these scholars were born and grew up in china and may have worked in the chinese government before coming to the united states. they have expertise on chinese politics and society that is hard to come by, because they can see things from the perspective of the chinese.  in the coming years, the united states will have

  as oil drifted onto beaches as far east as the florida panhandle, a bp official said saturday the company was pleased with its operation to funnel crude up from the ruptured undersea well to a drilling ship a mile above on the gulf of mexico.  bp senior vice president bob fryar said the company funneled about  ,  gallons of oil in the first   hours from a containment cap installed on the well to a drilling ship on the ocean surface.  \"that operation has gone extremely well,\" fryar said at an alabama news conference. \"we are very pleased.\"  thats about   percent of the  ,  gallons of crude federal authorities estimate is gushing into the sea every day.  the companys progress was not enough to temper the frustration seething among residents along the coastline.  tony kennon, the mayor of orange beach, alabama, confronted fryar at the afternoon news conference for not acting promptly when reports of tar balls washing ashore surfaced. visibly american et, kennon said local officials have been asking to meet with bp officials for over a month, but their requests went unanswered.  \"if you sensed our frustration, you would have been here a lot sooner,\" kennon told fryar. \"people in orange beach are starving to death now because they ca not  get out to catch the fish.\"  bp engineers are hoping to increase the amount being funneled to the drilling ship but have to be careful about the pressure within the cap that was placed on the well head a few days ago, said coast guard adm. thad allen, the federal governments response manager.  allen told reporters at a briefing saturday that bp plans to shut valves in the cap    which are allowing oil to escape    once the pressure is eased. the ultimate capacity of the operation is  ,  captured gallons a day, still shy of the amount spewing.  earlier, coastal residents had anxiously awaited news of bps progress as elevated southerly winds pushed the perimeter of the spilled oil to shorelines as far east as the florida panhandle. the national oceanic and atmospheric administration predicted that scattered tar balls and light sheen would impact beaches as far east as bay county, home to popular destinations in panama city.  florida beaches remained open saturday but the number of beachgoers was down. sun and surf were interrupted by sticky brown globs of oil washing up on the sugary sand and workers with blue rubber gloves and plastic bags trying to keep the beach clean.  florida gov. charlie crist walked the beach accompanied by \"margaritaville\" singer jimmy buffet, who is building a hotel on the pensacola shoreline.  \"i saw some tar balls,\" crist said. \"it is  terrible when you see something like that. it breaks your heart.\"  florida sen. george lemieux, a republican, demanded that bp donate    billion for a cleanup fund for the five gulf states and said that president obama \"needs to push them to do that.\"  \"i want to see this president more engaged here on the ground, working through problems,\" lemieux said.  the oil slick has already threatened ecologically sensitive lands along the gulf coast. images of oil drenched pelicans were all over the internet, prompting even more public anger toward bp.  obama sought in his weekly address saturday to ease fear along the gulf coast by reaffirming his commitment to clean up the worst oil spill in american . history.  \"it is  brutally unfair. it is  wrong,\" obama said in the address, recorded a day earlier in grand isle, louisiana. \"and what i told these men and women    and what i have said since the beginning of this disaster    is that i am  going to stand with the people of the gulf coast until they are made whole.\"  it appeared that bp was making progress after capping the breached well head, obama said, but he said the federal government was \"prepared for the worst.\" he cited a series of statistics that illuminated the \"largest response to an environmental disaster of this kind in the history of our country.\"  they are as follows   â\\x80¢  ,  national guard troops authorized for deployment.  â\\x80¢  ,  people currently working to protect water and coastlines.  â\\x80¢  ,  vessels are in the gulf assisting in the cleanup.  â\\x80¢  .  million feet of boom deployed with another  .  million feet of boom available, enough to stretch  ,  miles.  â\\x80¢   staging areas across louisiana, mississippi, alabama, and florida to rapidly defend sensitive shorelines.  meanwhile, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration on saturday reopened an area of the gulf to fishing. after reviewing images and data, the agency reopened more than  ,  square miles west of the florida keys and dry tortugas.  at the same time, it closed  ,  square miles off the florida panhandle, extending the northern boundary just east of the western edge of choctawhatchee bay. that means that   percent of the gulf still remains off limits for fishing.  the bp well erupted after an explosion and fire on the deepwater horizon drilling rig on april  . eleven people on board died and the bp leased rig sank two days later, leaving up to  ,  barrels   ,  gallons  of oil pouring into the gulf daily, according to federal estimates.  bp has struggled to contain the gushing oil, trying myriad methods to plug the well and divert the crude.  thursday was the first time the british oil giant was able to report progress, when it successfully lowered a containment cap on the ruptured well.  even if the funneling procedure is able to contain most of the oil, the solution is temporary, allen said. the gushing well can only be killed after bp completes drilling of two relief wells.  allen said the first relief well is about  ,  feet below the ocean floor. bp will have to go down to between  ,  and  ,  feet to be able to intercept the breached well.  the long term threat, allen said, will not go away until a relief well is completed. bp has said the earliest that will be done is august.

away valuable leverage to bring about political changes in cuba. he also took another opportunity to attack his potential opponent for the republican presidential nomination, kentucky sen. rand paul, who agrees with obamas decision to switch course on cuba.  the most vocal republican leading the fight against obamas rapprochement with cuba insisted again that obamas new policy wo not  bring democracy to the island.  \"my opposition to what the president has done is it wo not  do anything to further that cause  of democratization ,\" rubio said on nbcs \"meet the press.\" \"there has to be some reciprocal opening on their part toward democracy and there was none in this engagement.\"  rubio, who is cuban american, also said cuban democracy activists \"feel betrayed\" by obama.  \"he completely ignored them and threw them to the side in this whole process,\" rubio said, adding that he would have \"actively and vibrantly engaged\" those activists if he were president.  and the slugfest between rubio and paul continued sunday.  just days after rubio said paul \"does not  know what hes talking about,\" the kentucky senator swung back friday on fox news calling rubios remarks \"rude and intemperate\" and suggesting rubio was promoting \"a policy of isolationism\" toward cuba that has not  brought about regime change.  rubio did not  bow out on sunday, once again aiming his arrows at paul in a preview of what could come in an eventual republican presidential primary bout.  \"rand paul, if he wants to align himself and become a supporter of the obama foreign policy, particularly toward cuba, thats his right, he has a right to do that,\" rubio said on sunday.  rubio also accused paul of becoming the \"chief cheerleader of obamas foreign policy,\" on abcs \"this week.\"  that prompted paul and his senior adviser, doug stafford, to fire back.  \"with all due respect, sen. marco rubio was captain of the gop cheerleading team for obamas arming of syrian rebels, bombing libya resulting in a jihadist wonderland and illegally giving foreign aid to egypts military government. the rubio obama foreign policy has made the middle east and north africa less safe,\" stafford said in a statement provided to cnn.  rubio has won the support of most of his republican colleagues in the senate, with some joining him in attacking the policy shift and others, like incoming senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, deferring to rubios expertise on the subject.  defenders of obamas decision to ease sanctions on cuba and normalize diplomatic relations with the island nation, including paul, have called the embargo and sanctions on cuba a   year policy that has failed to provoke any political change and have pointed to american . decision decades ago to engage and trade with china and vietnam.  rubio on sunday looked to spin those examples to his advantage, saying the american . should \"learn our lessons from those policies,\" calling chinas regime more oppressive than when the american . normalized relations with china in the \\' s.  \"certainly the chinese economy has grown, but politically they are  more repressed than they were twenty or thirty years ago. theres no freedom of religion, no freedom of speech, no free access to the internet, no elections, no political parties,\" rubio said. \"so in essence, that is the model the cubans will try to follow.\"  and while embracing that analogy, rubio also dismissed a comparison between cuba and china when prompted about whether he would end the american .s trade relations with china if he became president, noting that there are \"geopolitical realities\" when it comes to the asian power.  \"my interest here is singular, and that is freedom and democracy for the people of cuba,\" rubio said. \"i just do not  think that this policy that the president has put in place furthers that goal. in fact, i think it makes it harder to achieve.\"  but rubio may not be the only florida politican with strong views on the issue entering the   gop fray of presidential hopefuls.  former gov. jeb bush, who announced this week he is \"actively\" exploring a presidential run, also slammed obama this week for rewarding cubas dictators, calling it an \"ill advised move.\"  and while bush has been a mentor to the younger rubio in many ways, rubio said a bush candidacy would not deter him from his own.  \"jeb if he runs will be a very credible and formidable candidate,\" said rubio, who has not yet made a decision about running. \"when you reach a point where you are  thinking about running for president    as i am    what you have to make your decision on is not on who else is running, it is  on whether you think thats the right place for you to achieve your agenda and serve

meanwhile, gaza city    the palestinian territorys most populated area    was a virtual ghost town as people headed south.  egyptian president hosni mubarak said he had ordered his troops to allow palestinians to cross into egypt because they were starving, according to egypts state run news agency mena.  in washington, white house spokeswoman dana perino said wednesday that the \"situation on the border with egypt and gaza is quite serious today and we are very concerned about it.\" state department officials have been in touch with involved parties, she said, including \"many in the egyptian government.\"  \"the focus should be on restoring the situation,\" said perino, who blamed hamas for the \"genesis of this problem,\" specifically, \"sending over to israel upwards of   rockets a day that are landing in its territory. so israels defending itself.\"  the mass movement of people into egypt began about   a.m. wednesday, when residents reported hearing explosions near the border. authorities said militants set off several explosions.  at least six spots on the border wall had been blown apart. in another stretch, a steel coil wall had been sheared off.  by daybreak, lines of people waited restlessly as a frontloader tore chunks of concrete from a border wall. hundreds of cars streamed toward rafah    on the egyptian border    unloading occupants who then jumped over.  john ging, head of the united nations relief and work agency in gaza, called the exodus \"the desperate acts of a desperate people.\"  \"everything that is needed for the sustainment of life here is in short supply or has run out,\" ging said.  border access between gaza and egypt has been greatly restricted since june  ,  when hamas took over the territory.  israels military reported wednesday that no rockets have been fired from gaza into israel as of   p.m.    a.m. et , marking a sharp reduction in what has been the daily launching of rockets.  in cairo, egyptian police wednesday arrested as many as   people on their way to demonstrations to show support for the palestinians in gaza, according to george ishaq, a spokesman for kifaya, an anti government movement in egypt.  student organizers at cairo university said several thousand protesters turned out for a similar demonstration on the schools campus.  in switzerland, where she is attending a conference, american . secretary of state condoleezza rice has blamed gazas hamas leadership for its defiance of the international community. hamas is a palestinian islamic fundamentalist organization which israel and the united states consider a terrorist organization.  rice said on tuesday that the mideast quartet    composed of the united nations, the european union, the united states and russia    is examining a plan by palestinian prime minister salam fayyad for the palestinian authority to take a greater role in monitoring border crossings between gaza and israel.  gaza receives about   percent of its electricity from israel, and the bulk of the remaining power comes from a generation plant in gaza. that plant relies on fuel supplied by an israeli company. email to a

daughter and the pilot were \"being used as a scapegoat.\"  lynn morris says she was shocked at how her daughter, the planes co pilot, was portrayed in the ntsb hearings.  lynn morris\\' daughter, first officer rebecca shaw, was among the   people killed in the crash of the plane, operated by colgan air. morris made the comments on the final day of investigative hearings held by the national transportation safety board.  \"i think i walked out of the hearings in shock, because i truly felt that both she and the captain were being used as a scapegoat,\" morris said.  testimony from the hearings, which began tuesday, revealed that fatigue may have contributed to the failure of shaw and colgan air capt. marvin renslow to save the plane as it approached buffalo niagara international airport.  testimony on wednesday indicated that crews on a number of airlines could be suffering from lack of sleep. many crews live far from their base of operations, causing them to come to work already tired from travel, ntsb investigators said.  renslow had nearly a full day off before assuming command of continental connection flight  . yet the ntsb investigation found he slept in the newark airport crew lounge    against colgan air regulations. the airline, though, appears not to have been enforcing that rule.  \"nobody argues that the human body needs to have its rest, and sometimes it does not  gel with the schedules of an airline,\" testified capt. rory kay, executive air safety chairman for the air line pilots association.  watch hearing address issues of crew fatigue â»  ntsb board member kitty higgins said the colgan policy \"is that they are  not to sleep in the crew room, but it turns out they are sleeping in the crew room.\"  daniel morgan, colgans vice president for flight safety, said, \"people can come in between their flights to take a nap.\" asked if napping was considered sleeping, he replied, \"thats a definition i am  probably not prepared to answer.\"  a nap of about   to   minutes can be restorative for most people, dr. michael silber, a co director of the center for sleep medicine at the mayo clinic in minnesota, told the clinics monthly \"womens healthsource\" publication last year. however, a longer nap can make people feel groggy, silber said for the publications october issue.  shaw had three days off before the flight. she commuted through the night from seattle, washington, catching rides on connecting fed ex flights to get to newark, new jersey, where the colgan flight originated.  \"it is shocking. it is  hard to believe that it is allowed to go on,\" said kathy johnson, whose husband, kevin, died in the crash. she said wednesday she was furious that the crew may have been functioning on little sleep.  watch family members question pilot training standards â»  the ntsb, which has not issued its report on the february   crash, said it scheduled the hearings to gather information. the plane plunged into a house in clarence center, new york, killing everyone on board and a man on the ground.  the ntsbs preliminary investigation determined there was some ice accumulation on the bombardier dash   q  aircraft, but the \"icing had a minimal impact on the stall speed of the airplane.\"  on thursday, safety board member deborah hersman questioned why renslow and shaw apparently did not  notice, as they approached the buffalo airport, that the planes speed had abruptly dropped from   mph to   mph  from   to   knots .  she asked r. key dismukes, chief scientist for the nasa division that focuses on human centered design and operations, whether this was a period in every flight that is a time of high workload for the crew, meaning their attention may have been diverted.  dismukes noted that there was a lot going on, including conversations between renslow and shaw and communication with a control tower.  \"that certainly did not  help the workload situation,\" dismukes said. \"there were a number of concurrent tasks, and this is a vulnerable period. no questions about it.\"  hersman said she had seen the same failure to note a drastic, quick change in speed in other crashes. she suggested that the crew receive an alert in those cases.  \"i think an alert that your air speed is deteriorating is kind of like a fire alarm,\" hersman said.  on wednesday, it was revealed that renslow, in his colgan air job application, failed to reveal two pilot exam failures.  the crew also violated a rule that requires cockpit conversation to be focused on the flight.  at tuesdays hearing, colgan air acknowledged that renslow had never trained on the \"stick pusher\" emergency system in a flight simulator. the system warns pilots when the planes speed is too slow.  but in a written statement, the carrier said both renslow and shaw had received other specific training on how to handle situations like those that preceded the crash.  cnns allan chernoff contributed to this

confirmed deaths in the united states related to swine flu as of tuesday afternoon. but another virus had killed thousands of people since january and is expected to keep killing hundreds of people every week for the rest of the year.  people are nervous about swine flu, but the regular flu kills  ,  people a year in the united states.  that one  the regular flu.  an outbreak of swine flu that is suspected in more than   deaths in mexico and has sickened dozens of people in the united states and elsewhere has grabbed the attention of a nervous public and of medical officials worried the strain will continue to mutate and spread.  experts are nervous that, as a new strain, the swine flu will be harder to stop because there are not  any vaccines to fight it.  but even if there are swine flu deaths outside mexico    and medical experts say there very well may be    the virus would have a long way to go to match the roughly  ,  deaths that seasonal influenza causes in the united states each year.  \"that happens on an annual basis,\" dr. brian currie said tuesday. currie is vice president and medical director at montefiore medical center in bronx, new york.  since january, more than  ,  people have died of complications from seasonal flu, according to the centers for disease control and preventions weekly report on the causes of death in the nation.  no fewer than   flu related deaths were reported in any week between january   and april  , the most recent week for which figures were available.  the report looks at deaths in the   largest cities in the united states.  worldwide, the annual death toll from the flu is estimated to be between  ,  and  , .  about   out of   of those deaths are among people older than  , currie said. most times, they already have health problems that the flu makes worse, he said.  \"regular influenza can be taxing,\" he said. \"it causes their underlying disease to decompensate and then they do not  have the reserves to get through it.  \"while it may not be the direct cause listed on the death certificate, it certainly contributed.\"  one of the reasons medical experts are nervous about the swine flu outbreak is that many of the people who have died in mexico have been young and otherwise healthy. the strains found in the united states have so far been weaker.  but even the regular flu is sometimes fatal for younger victims.  \"it is  not unheard of. it happens, either directly from influenza or they get a bacterial superinfection\" like staph, said currie.  while researchers have not  developed a vaccine to fight the new swine flu, it can be treated with antiviral drugs tamiflu and relenza, the same drugs used on the regular flu.  many times, seasonal flu itself is tough to prevent because it has mutated to a form different than it was when the vaccine was made.  seeking to put the swine flu outbreak in perspective tuesday, los angeles county public health officer dr. jonathan fielding echoed other public officials calling it \"cause for concern, but not for alarm.\"  \"given the size of l.a. county, given the traffic between here and mexico, it would be very surprising if we did not  have any cases,\" fielding said.  he said the county, where the cdc had confirmed   cases of swine flu by tuesday, sees more than  ,  flu related deaths every year.  \"so it would also not be surprising if there were deaths with swine flu    even if it had the pattern of seasonal flu,\" he said. \"thus far, the pattern we see in the united states is very similar to that of seasonal flu    relatively mild to moderate cases.\"  cnns samira simone and kc wildmoon contributed to this report.   highlight  swine flu getting focus, but so far it is  not deadly in united states   highlight  since

minutes someones brother, mother, sister, father, or neighbor becomes infected with hiv in the united states. thats  ,  people every year. but theres something we can all do to help protect ourselves and our partners from this disease    get tested for hiv.  in the fight against hiv, i can tell you that few things are more important than testing. it is  an essential step in reducing the number of new hiv infections and extending the lives of those who are infected.  put simply, hiv testing saves lives.  as a cdc official, i have  spoken with hundreds of people who have made the decision to get tested. many described the relief they felt when they found out they were hiv negative.  thanks to the hiv test, they could take steps to make sure they and their partners stay that way. i have  also met people who found out they were hiv positive.  although initially worried about their diagnosis and their future, they were thankful they had their infection diagnosed early, and were able to live long, healthy and productive lives with hiv. they had the knowledge and will to protect their partners from infection, or to prevent their infants from becoming hiv infected.  i recently met one young woman who learned about her hiv infection after being diagnosed during routine hiv testing in pregnancy. by getting tested early, and having access to effective treatment, her child was born without hiv, and she now has two healthy children.  she is a living testament that life does not stop with this disease. instead, knowledge of her hiv status along with effective treatment and care has given her the freedom, resolve and respect to make choices to protect her life and the lives of those she loves.  yet today, not everyone has benefited from knowing their hiv status. far too many individuals with hiv do not  know that they are  infected. cdc estimates that one in five people with hiv in the united states is unaware of being infected.  thats more than  ,  americans who may be transmitting the virus to others without knowing it, and who ca not  take advantage of hiv treatments that could prolong and improve the quality of their lives. as we mark national hiv testing day on saturday, i strongly encourage all americans to get tested for hiv.  at cdc, our goal is to make hiv testing as routine as a blood pressure check. hiv testing has never been quicker, easier or more accessible. in fact, with rapid hiv tests, results can be available in as little as   minutes, and tests can be given in your doctors office or other locations in your community, such as churches and college campuses.  to ensure that all americans know their hiv status, cdc recommends that everyone between the ages of   and   get tested for hiv as part of routine medical care    regardless of their perceived risk for infection. cdc also recommends that those at increased risk, such as sexually active gay and bisexual men, get tested at least annually. we are also working with our partners to bring hiv testing services directly to communities across the nation.  increased hiv testing will make it possible to significantly reduce the number of new infections. research indicates the majority of new sexually transmitted hiv infections are transmitted by people who do not know they are hiv infected. studies also show that most people who test hiv positive take steps to protect their partners from infection.  nearly   years after the start of the epidemic, far too many people continue to be diagnosed late in the course of their infection. too many times, i have  heard stories from people who went to the emergency room after a few days of flu like symptoms. once there, doctors conduct tests and inform them they have both pneumonia and aids. they never knew they were hiv infected, and yet they had the virus for years.  in fact, data released today show that nearly   percent of people develop aids within just a year of being diagnosed with hiv. many of these people could have stayed healthier if they were diagnosed with hiv and began drug treatment much earlier. anti retroviral treatment can lower the amount of the virus in the blood, slowing progression from hiv to aids.  we must remember that aids still kills in this country    more than  ,  people die every year. yet we have the tools to diagnose an hiv infection early, to begin life prolonging treatments to prevent progression to aids, and to ensure a strong quality of life for hiv infected people.  but without a test, there is no diagnosis    and no treatment.  the fight against hiv here at home is far from over. but too many mistakenly believe that hiv in the united states is no longer a serious problem. in fact, a recent survey by the kaiser family foundation found a troubling decline in awareness and concern about the domestic hiv/aids crisis, in the general population and among those at greatest risk.  to help combat this complacency, the white house recently joined cdc and the rest of the american . department of health and human services to announce a new communication campaign, \"act against aids.\" the campaign is working on a number of fronts to refocus national attention on the american . epidemic, and to increase the number of americans who get tested for hiv.  although hiv/aids continues to pose a serious threat to the nations health, hiv testing is a powerful weapon against the disease. by increasing the number of people who know their hiv status, we can decrease the number of new hiv infections, and help save thousands of lives.  what you do not  know can hurt you. in fact, it can kill you. but a simple test could change your fate and the fate of others. thats why today i urge all americans to take the test    and take control.  to learn more about hiv/aids and where you can receive a confidential hiv test, visit hivtest.org, call   cdc info, or text your zip code to \"know it\"    . for comprehensive information about hiv prevention,

airlines flight  .  the results speak to the fruitlessness of it.  the plane, carrying   people, disappeared on march  . and despite an expansive search involving   countries, officials have nothing to show for it.  so authorities are moving on to the next phase of the search    one that will be even more challenging.  \"we know very clearly the area of the follow up search will be even broader, with more difficulties and tougher tasks,\" chinese transport minister yang chuantang said monday.  what is  next  australian, malaysian and chinese officials will meet in canberra, australia, on wednesday to hash out plans for the next stage of the hunt.  one group will analyze the data and information collected so far. another will look at the resources needed.  the data audit will look at information gathered since the beginning of the search.  \"it will also look again at the satellite information thats been accumulated so that we can make sure that it is  been accurately interpreted,\" australian deputy prime minister warren truss said.  authorities have relied on satellite information and pings believed to be from the planes flight data recorders in picking their search area.  but with an expanded search area comes the most challenging task ahead  scouring uncharted territory.  a key element of the new phase will be a detailed mapping of the ocean floor.  \"we know that the water is very deep,\" truss said. \"and for the next stage involving sonar and other autonomous vehicles, potentially at very great depths, we need to have an understanding of the ocean floor to be able to undertake that kind of search effectively and safely.\"  truss said hes not sure how deep the ocean is in the expanded search area because \"it is  never been mapped.\"  the tools  the next stage of the hunt will involved highly specialized technology, including towed side scan sonar and more autonomous underwater vehicles, truss said.  \"you can count on one hand the number of devices that can do this work, when you talk about towed sonar devices,\" said angus houston, chief coordinator of the joint search effort.  truss said hes optimistic that the new devices will be in the water within a month or two. in the meantime, he said, the bluefin   drone will continue underwater missions.  the bluefin   has already scanned   square kilometers of the indian ocean floor, but with no luck. the united states has authorized the use of the drone for another month. the cost  about   ,  a day.  while the bluefin   provides greater resolution than deep towed sonar devices, the drone can only go about  .  kilometers deep.  the cost  australia estimates the next phase of the search will cost about    million, truss said. he said officials will consult with malaysia, china and other parties on how that cost would be shared.  until now, all countries involved in the search have paid for their own costs.  \"whenever we have  asked, people have come forward,\" truss said. but \"i think we will  be looking at increasing involvement from the manufacturers and their host countries.\"  letting others in  the new phase will allow more parties to join the search, acting malaysian transport minister hishammuddin hussein said.  \"this gives an opportunity to those not involved in the early phase of the search and rescue efforts to come on board,\" he said.  those could involve research institutions and more countries, he said.  truss said most of the new equipment will likely have to come from the private sector.  lessons learned  it took two years to find the wreckage of air france flight   in the atlantic ocean.  truss said authorities can learn from that effort.  \"there were some quite long gaps in their search, and we do not  want that to happen in this instance,\" he said. \"thats why we are  starting work this week on actually putting together the next stages of the search.\"  but as officials from this search have already learned, hope can dash as quickly as it arises.  \"we have  been confident on the basis of the information provided that the search area was the right one,\" truss said. \"but in practice, that confidence has not been converted into us discovering any trace of the aircraft.\"   highlight  officials will review data to see if satellite information has been \"accurately interpreted\"   highlight  more high tech

representatives from the two countries are back at it today after a full day of talks yesterday. this is the first time in eight months that north and south korea have had direct contact with each other. the silence started after the south blamed the north for two military attacks last year.  these talks are happening at a truce village. the representatives did not  come to any conclusions yesterday, but they said there were not  any political arguments from either side. the goal of these meetings is to set up another round of talks between officials who are higher up in their countries\\' governments. south korea says it will  only agree to those if north korea promises not to provoke the south any more.  australia brushfires  azuz  next up, australia, where officials are promising one million dollars to a fund for wildfire victims. we have  talked recently about floods and a cyclone in eastern australia. these fires were in western australia, on the other side of the

video   tegan sapwell, ten network reporter  it is  absolutely heartbreaking to see what people are going through here. theres just so many stories, and each one of them really touches your heart. a short time ago, a man returned to the home here behind me where he saw what was left of his house for the first time. it was obviously incredibly emotional. but what really struck me was as he was leaving, he walked away and shrugged his shoulders and said, \"oh well, you know, i will  just rebuild.\" i think that really shows the real aussie spirit there.  another example  i spoke to a couple earlier today that had tears pouring down their faces as they spoke about what they lost. but all they wanted to do was to thank the firefighters for their efforts for putting their lives on the line as they tried to save their home. so, i think thats just amazing.  what is  actually believed to have happened is it was sparked by a power tool. on sunday, conditions here were just hot and windy. and as a result, we had what is  called a total fire ban, which means people are not  allowed to use power tools. what is  actually believed to have happened is a resident was using a power tool. hes actually a police officer. and that is what started the fire. as a result, he now faces possible criminal charges over this. it is  a very serious matter, and the arson squad is now investigating.

investigating why some toyota vehicles sped up for no apparent reason. in   and  , we reported on when the car company recalled millions of cars because of this problem. some critics thought it might have been caused by the vehicles\\' electronic throttle systems. but according to the testing, thats not the case. the government says, so far, the only known causes of the problem are sticky pedals and floor mats that got in the way of the pedals. officials say it is  also possible that drivers may have gotten confused and pushed the gas instead of the brake. toyota is facing hundreds of lawsuits related to this issue.  shoutout  tomeka jones, cnn student news  todays shoutout goes out to mr. dichs world geography class at horning middle school in waukesha, wisconsin  the words

the presence of women.  the first is \"fat.\"  i know i do not  go there.  and i do not  see a good reason why any man should.  when women use the word around me i pretend not to hear it, and if asked a question with the word \"fat\" in it, i sneeze in my hand and then ask for a tissue. juvenile, yes, but it allows me to change the subject without having to answer the question. and i do not  ever want to answer that question.  speaking of questions, the second word we should all stay away from is \"weave.\"  i do not  care if a man sees a woman bald at the office on wednesday, with blond finger waves at the club on friday, and with jet black hair down to her butt at church on sunday    if anyone asks if she wears a weave, the answer is \"i do not  know.\" she could be holding a receipt from weaves r us in one hand, and five pounds of hair in the other, and he should say \"i am  not sure.\"  at the salon where i get my dreadlocks retwisted, every third woman walks in with a bag of hair. i keep my head down, eyes closed and try not to breathe. i want to be as invisible as possible, because the last thing i want is for a woman in there to think i am  aware of her lace front, glued in, braided back or whatever it is shes got going on up there.  and every man i know harbors that same level of sexism/wisdom/fear.  which is why i had to talk to blaine stewart, who was not only brave and/or stupid enough to bring up his co workers weave    he did it right in front of her face.  on live tv.  stewart and laila muhammad host the morning show for wgnt in norfolk, virginia. during the halloween broadcast, stewart blew out the candle inside the jack o\\' lantern sitting on the desk. muhammad joked that if the smoke from the candle set off the studio sprinkler system, \"i am  done for the day.\"  \"sitting up here looking like a mop,\" she said.  thats when my main man stewart chimed in, \"you do not want a sprinkler system and a beautiful weave, because they do not go together.\"  right now you are  probably thinking  oh no he did not .  and i am  here to tell you  oh yes he did.  and even as muhammad stared at him with her mouth hanging open and a high pitched wail filling the room, poor stewart went on to say \"you said it was a weave    right \"  i had not  laughed that hard at a youtube clip since antoine dodson told us to hide our kids. and sites such as ybf and lipstick alley had a field day.  \"i knew the first rule about not talking about fat, but i did not  know the second,\" he said. \"no one told me about the second.\"  which is why i had to write this column, in an effort to save lives this holiday season. men, i do not  care if half of her track is dangling in a pot of black eyed peas, you do not acknowledge that weave. you sneeze in your hand and go to the bathroom and pray that an aunt, a cousin, someone has told her by the time you get out.  now, muhammad and stewart are great friends, and their rapport plays well on camera    even while \"weave gate\" was unfolding. the two even put out a follow up to try to add more context to the story. stewart, who is bald, said the two actually talk about weaves on the show quite a bit, something he attributes to his latent hair envy.  muhammad said the fact that she wears a weave is not a secret at the studio. she actually has long hair that is not  permed, but she chooses to wear a weave because daily exposure to the heat from the studio lights can damage hair. but muhammad said while she was comfortable with stewart and others knowing, she was shocked \"he put all of my business out there like that.\"  \"i was not  mad at him    but he clearly did not  know the rule,\" she said, laughing. \"no, i did not  run to hr. no, i did not  beat him up off set. no, i did not  have to explain my blackness to him afterwards. it was clear he was trying to make a compliment. ... he did not  mean to call me out.\"  but that did not  stop some people from drawing a different, less forgiving conclusion.  \"i was a little surprised by some of the pretty harsh things people said about me,\" stewart said. \"i do not  believe i am  a racist or a white devil or a bitchy queen as some people have posted about me. i just was not  thinking.  \"but it is  funny, we can talk about fake eyelashes, lip gloss, makeup and all of the other enhancements that we do, but when it comes to hair, we keep quiet. it is  the last taboo.\"  thats when i stepped in and reminded stewart that while \"weave gate\" was bad, hair is not the last taboo. and if he did not  believe me, he should try bringing up the word \"fat\" and see what happens.  of course, i wo not  do it.  i know the rules.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of lz granderson.

life has never been easy. born into poverty and war, his ears and tail were chopped off when he was just a few months old in preparation for dog fighting. he escaped to find a better life, only to be trapped in lonely, sterile quarantine for six months.  bear plays for the first time out of quarantine after coming to britain from afghanistan.  but all that changed monday when bear the dog stepped out of british quarantine and through the doors of a london animal shelter.  \"hes absolutely a loving dog,\" said former british royal marine paul \"penny\" farthing, who helped bring bear to england. \"he just loves people. it is  a good thing he was brought back to the u.k. when he was quite young, so hes never gone through having to fend for himself in the street and be made to dogfight.\"  an unknown soldier in afghanistan first found bear last year and brought him to a local afghan animal shelter. the shelter was not  able to care for bear, so it contacted farthing, who now runs a charity for stray and abandoned animals, primarily dogs from afghanistan. farthings nowzad dogs is named for the afghan town where he was based for a few months in  . he asked mayhew international, an arm of londons mayhew animal home, to help find bear a new home.  mayhew international says bear is one of the few dogs it has brought back to britain. usually it tries to find animals new homes within their own countries.  \"although mayhew international does not encourage people to bring dogs to the u.k. from abroad as a general policy, we made an exception in this case as it was the perfect opportunity to highlight the plight of thousands of stray animals in afghanistan,\" the organization said in a statement.  bears story may be unique, but he is certainly not alone. mayhew international, which works around the world to educate people about animal welfare, says there are countless dogs in afghanistan that are homeless or trapped in a life of dogfighting    an increasingly popular pastime in afghanistan.  \"animal welfare is not looked so highly upon in afghanistan,\" said christopher sainsbury, mayhews international projects officer.  \"in war torn areas, people tend to forget the animal welfare side of things. [we want to] make people aware that this is a key side of things that needs to be assessed, needs to be worked on.\"  bear is a koochi dog, a large breed common in afghanistan, according to dr. mohammadzai abduljalil, a mayhew veterinarian from afghanistan. while no one knows bears exact age, abduljalil said they believe he is just about a year old.  you would not  know it by bears size. hes already a large dog nearly   feet high with large paws to match.  stepping into the mayhew play area monday for the first time, bear made sure to sniff every corner of the room and mark his territory a few times before settling in to play. he had a puppys curiosity and quickly started playing fetch and tug of war with farthing, wagging enthusiastically the small part of his tail which is left.  bear is lucky. he escaped a violent and uncertain future in afghanistan.  not so for many other dogs left behind. it is those dogs that farthing hopes to help with his charity.  \"they need someone to look after them, so why not me \" farthing said.  it began when the royal marines arrived in the war torn town of now zad, in afghanistans helmand province, in october  . they found stray dogs wandering the streets, scavenging for food, dodging bullets and seeking shelter from the hot days and cold nights. many were also being used for dogfighting, with their ears and tails docked to make the fights last longer and give their opponents less to bite.  farthing and other marines began to feed and care for a few dogs that wandered into their camp. at first they had three dogs, but other strays soon figured out the camp was a source of food and shelter, and before long the marines found themselves caring for seven dogs and   puppies.  time was running out, however. the marines were due to leave now zad in february   and knew they could not  take the dogs with them. they looked for some way to make sure the dogs would be taken care of after they left.  thats when farthing first contacted mayhew international. they put him in touch with a small shelter in northern afghanistan that mayhew had assisted since its inception, providing advice and veterinary support.  the shelter offered to take the dogs on one condition  the marines had to arrange for the dogs\\' transfer to kabul, a difficult and dangerous three days\\' drive away.  finding a taxi willing to accept dogs was the first hurdle; the second was that the drivers refused to allow the dogs to be transported in western style cages, which would give away to the taliban that the car was carrying foreigners.  instead, the dogs had to be tied with ropes, the afghan way, and the puppies had to be stashed in small crates    in this case, a bird cage.  \"a lot was done on trust,\" farthing told cnn. \"the afghans did it as a favor to us. we paid for some of their fuel and their costs, but it was fantastic. it was them helping us out. they did not  have to do it. it shows that the people of afghanistan and us, we can work together.\"  in the end, most of the dogs made it to kabul, but not without casualties. two were left behind for lack of room in the taxi, and two more escaped along the way when a car door was accidentally left open. three of the largest puppies were stolen, probably for dog fighting.  three dogs and eleven puppies finally made it to the shelter, but nine of the puppies later died due to an outbreak of disease and shortage of vaccines.  sainsbury, of mayhew international, says the story of the now zad dogs and of bear shows their efforts can help animals, even if it is  just one at a time.  mayhew international works with organizations already established in developing countries to plan mass sterilization drives that reduce the number of unwanted animals. they also train veterinary surgeons in modern neutering techniques that are quick and humane.  \"the way that war makes looking after animal welfare harder is quite clear,\" sainsbury said. \"animal welfare gets forgotten and it becomes a back burner because organizations ... that were working in those war torn countries will probably be unable to operate any longer. they will  be unable to aid the populations of stray and community animals which would rely on their help originally.\"  mayhew ceo caroline yates said staff have no idea how long it will take for bear to find a new home. they hope the publicity surrounding his arrival in britain will encourage people to think about adopting him.  yates said they hope to have him adopted within a month.  said farthing, \"to be able to help just one [dog] is a reward in itself and a huge step to highlighting the undocumented suffering that animals in all war zones are subjected to.\"   highlight  bear the dog was born into poverty, had ears

ambitions, israel was fierce in its criticism sunday.  \"what was concluded in geneva last night is not a historic agreement, it is  a historic mistake,\" israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu told reporters. \"it is  not made the world a safer place. like the agreement with north korea in  , this agreement has made the world a much more dangerous place.\"  \"for years the international community has demanded that iran cease all uranium enrichment. now, for the first time, the international community has formally consented that iran continue its enrichment of uranium.\"  washington said the changes called for in the agreement will make iran less of a threat to israel.  \"we believe very strongly that because the iranian nuclear program is actually set backwards and is actually locked into place in critical places, that that is better for israel than if you were just continuing to go down the road and they rush towards a nuclear weapon,\" american . secretary of state john kerry told cnns state of the union.  netanyahu disagreed.  the deal, netanyahu argued, leaves iran \"taking only cosmetic steps which it could reverse easily within a few weeks, and in return, sanctions that took years to put in place are going to be eased.\"  \"this first step could very well be the last step,\" he said.  \"without continued pressure, what incentive does the iranian regime have to take serious steps that actually dismantle its nuclear weapons capability \"  mark regev, a spokesman for netanyahu, said easing pressure will remove any motivation for irans leaders to make difficult decisions.  \"it is  like having a small hole in your tire, a small hole in the sanctions regime,\" he said. \"in the end, like with your tire, you will  get a flat.\"  obama discusses deal with netanyahu  u.s. president barack obama tried to ease the close american . allys concerns on sunday, calling netanyahu to discuss the deal.  white house spokesman josh earnest said obama focused on conveying a key point  the united states remains committed to closely consulting with israel throughout the negotiations with iran.  the roughly   minute conversation between the two leaders was a \"useful discussion,\" earnest said.  \"the president underscored that the united states will remain firm in our commitment to israel, which has good reason to be skeptical about irans intentions,\" the white house said in a statement describing the phone call.  obama also stressed that the united states and israel share a common goal, making sure iran never obtains a nuclear weapon.  kerry   have ry little relief\\' for iran  kerry argued that the deal will make israel safer by freezing some iranian nuclear development and removing its stockpile of uranium enriched to    purity.  and he said the sanctions part of the agreement is hardly a boost for iran.  \"there is very little relief. we are convinced over the next few months, we will really be able to put to the test what irans intentions are,\" kerry told cnn chief political correspondent candy crowley.  the deal says that the american . will provide    billion to    billion in sanction relief    just a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly    billion in foreign exchange holdings that are inaccessible to iran because of sanctions, the white house says.  iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian purposes, with no long term goal of developing a nuclear weapons arsenal.  but such assurances have not  quelled sharp skepticism from israel.  \"if in five years, a nuclear suitcase explodes in new york or madrid,\" said naftali bennett, the israeli minister of trade and industry, \"it will be because of the agreement that was signed this morning.\"  shimon peres, israels president, sounded a different note.  \"this is an interim deal. the success or failure of the deal will be judged by results, not by words,\" peres said in a statement.  \"i would like to say to the iranian people  you are not our enemies, and we are not yours. there is a possibility to solve this issue diplomatically. it is in your hands. reject terrorism. stop the nuclear program. stop the development of long range missiles. israel, like others in the international community, prefers a diplomatic solution.  \"but i want to remind everyone of what president obama said, and what i have personally heard from other leaders. the international community will not tolerate a nuclear iran. and if the diplomatic path fails, the nuclear option will be prevented by other means. the alternative is far worse.\"  spokesman  israel reserves the right to defend itself  to be sure, there is no love lost between iran and israel.  iran, which in the past has questioned israels right to even exist, continues to push israels buttons with incendiary statements.  israel, which says it has the most to lose if iran develops a nuclear bomb, has repeatedly warned the west to tread warily when dealing with tehran.  so finding that their greatest ally, the united states, has struck an interim deal with iran brought condemnation from israeli lawmakers.  \"israel cannot participate in the international celebration, which is based on iranian deception and the world self delusion,\" said yuval steinitz, minister of strategic and intelligence affairs responsible for international relations, and a member of the knesset.  lawmakers stopped short of saying whether israel would go it alone militarily, if the need arose.  but israeli officials told cnns ian lee they would not rule out a strike against iran    and netanyahu certainly did not  mince words.  in a written statement, he said israel \"is not obliged to the agreement.\"  \"the regime in iran is dedicated to destroying israel and israel has the right and obligation to defend itself with its own forces against every threat,\" he said. \"i want to make clear as the prime minister of israel, israel will not let iran develop a nuclear military capability.\"  israel bombed a reactor construction site in iraq in  .  asked by cnns wolf blitzer about the possibility of an israeli airstrike on irans nuclear facilities in the next six months, netanyahus spokesman did not  rule out that option.  \"we, of course, would like to see a diplomatic solution. we would  like to see a peaceful dismantling of the iranian nuclear program. if that can be achieved, thats obviously preferable,\" regev said. \"but israel always reserves the right ... to defend ourselves, by ourselves, against possible threats.\"  israeli leaders sleep with one eye open\\'  it is  hard for most americans to understand why all israeli prime ministers are said to sleep with one eye open, said aaron david miller of the woodrow wilson international center for scholars. he was a middle east negotiator in democratic and republican administrations.  america, he says, has \"nonpredatory neighbors to its north and south and fish to its east and west.\"  israel, on the other hand, is a small jewish state surrounded by antagonistic muslim neighbors.  \"i do not  think iran wants nuclear weapons to launch a first strike against israel. but it is  impossible to ignore, let alone trivialize, israeli security concerns and vulnerabilities in this regard, particularly in the face of irans rhetoric, regional ambitions and support for terrorism over the years,\" he said.  indeed, the verbal attacks have been relentless.  even as the p +  met in geneva, irans supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei unleashed another volley last week in tehran.  khamenei said israeli officials \"cannot be even called humans\" and referred to netanyahu as \"the rabid dog of the region.\"  when iranian president hassan rouhani described the deal on sunday, widows and children of slain iranian nuclear scientists stood nearby as he addressed them in his speech.  iranian officials have long accused israel of planting bombs under the scientists\\' cars, and analysts have argued thats a likely scenario.  israel generally refuses to comment on accusations and speculation. after one such attack killed an iranian scientist last year, israeli military spokesman brig. gen. yoav mordechai said in a facebook post that he did not  know who would  targeted the scientist.  \"but i certainly did not  shed a tear,\" he said.  once a \\'honeymoon\\'  what is often forgotten in this tense relationship is that it was not  always this way.  after the birth of the nation of israel in  , it and iran enjoyed a \"honeymoon\" that lasted until just before the   islamic revolution, david menashri, professor emeritus of tel aviv university, told cnn last year.  israels ties with iran were chiefly motivated by \"a single word with three letters    o i l,\" he said.  but the islamic revolution that overthrew the shah of iran marked a turning point.  the islamic republic, led by shiite clerics in the predominantly shiite nation, saw israel as an illegitimate state with no right to exist, certainly not amid muslim nations.  despite harsh rhetoric, though, then supreme leader ayatollah khomeini \"did not  want to get into a confrontation with israel,\" said ervand abrahamian, a professor of iranian and middle eastern history at baruch college of the city university of new york.  one reason  israel and iran had a common enemy in iraq, a country that fought an eight year war with iran. israel even supplied weapons to iran to help it fight.  in the years after the iran iraq war, however, israel began to regard iran and its support of global terror as a chief threat.  and it watched uneasily as iran has gained influence in the middle east since the first gulf war began eroding iraqs power.  those concerns escalated when international inspectors found traces of highly enriched uranium at a power plant in iran in  .  in the escalating conflict, the united states has always said, in the words of obama last year, that it has \"israels back.\"  \"the united states has no stake in concluding an agreement with iran that leaves israel angry, aggrieved and vulnerable. so, the two sides will find a way to work this through,\" miller said. \"but

detainees in recent years, is setting up a committee to look into releasing political prisoners after long refusing to admit they were being held in the southeast asian countrys jails.  president thein sein, whose government has introduced a string of political reforms that have led to improved ties with western nations, ordered the establishment of the committee to define the term \"political prisoner\" and review relevant cases, authorities said thursday.  terrorized, starving and homeless  myanmars rohingya still forgotten  myanmar is gradually emerging from decades of authoritarian military rule that resulted in internal oppression and international isolation.  thein sein, a former military official, has overseen the introduction of greater political freedoms, peace talks with ethnic rebels and the successful participation of pro democracy leader aung san suu kyi and her party in legislative elections.  western governments have responded by easing economic sanctions and stepping up diplomatic ties. in november, president barack obama became the first sitting american . president to visit myanmar, giving a powerful symbolic nod to its fledgling reforms.  friday, the united states welcomed news of the committees formation.  \"by establishing an inclusive, transparent review mechanism to ensure the release of all remaining political prisoners, the government has taken an important step towards national reconciliation,\" state department spokeswoman victoria nuland said.  from burma to myanmar  land of rising expectations  doubts still remain about the commitment to lasting reform by officials in myanmar, also known as burma, in the light of sectarian unrest in the western state of rakhine, recent fighting between the military and ethnic rebels in kachin, and a heavy crackdown on protesters outside a copper mine project.  a stumbling block in talks  one stumbling block the myanmar government has come up against in talks with other political parties and governments is its refusal to use the term \"political prisoner\" to describe some of those behind bars, according to ye htut, a spokesman for the president.  myanmar  testing the limits of reform  \"we cannot negotiate because of this term,\" he said by phone. \"thats why president thein sein instructed to form this committee to find the definition.\"  the government, which pledged to set up such a mechanism during obamas visit, says it hopes the committee will include representatives from other political parties and groups representing political prisoners.  the assistance association for political prisoners  aapp , a prisoner rights and support group, said the government had invited it to help with the committees work.  the initiative is \"a good sign,\" said bo kyi, joint secretary of aapp, which is run by former political prisoners. but he added that \"we have to wait and see until more political prisoners are released.\"  hundreds believed to still be in prison  aung san suu kyi spent many years under house arrest before authorities released her in  . a lot of members of her party, the national league for democracy, were imprisoned under the military junta.  the new committee will try to determine the the number of political prisoners being held in myanmar, ye htut said, noting that the government had received different estimates from different organizations.  \"the president also wants to release more political prisoners to implement national reconciliation,\" he added.  as many as several hundred political prisoners remain behind bars in myanmar, human rights watch, a american . based advocacy group, said in a report last week.  furthermore, it said, \"freed political prisoners face restrictions on travel and education, and lack adequate psychosocial support.\"  asked whether he would visit political prisoners around myanmar, bo kyi of aapp said he would rather \"see my colleagues outside, not in the jails.\"  journalist phyo

developments in and around north korea are so worrisome that they appear to have frightened dick cheney. the   year old former vice president stopped by to visit with gop lawmakers tuesday and wound up talking about unpredictable, and perhaps american table, north korean leader kim jong un. according to sources present at the meeting, cheney offered this blunt assessment of the crisis in the korean peninsula  \"we are  in deep doo doo.\"  oh, thats just terrific. it is  spring, and the cherry blossoms are in full bloom in the nations capital. and so naturally our thoughts turn to... the threat of thermonuclear war   we interrupt the politically driven debates in washington over gun control and immigration control to bring you an important message about a world leader who may be out of control.  welcome to the north korean missile crisis. subtitled  the missiles of april.  it is  time to think the unthinkable. in fact, if you live in hawaii, guam, the pacific islands or, as i do, on the west coast of the united states    or, for that matter, anywhere else within range of this bad neighborhood    it is  probably long past time.  just this week, cnn reported this   \"the obama administration now calculates it is likely north korea may test fire mobile ballistic missiles at any time based on the most recent american . intelligence showing it is likely the north koreans have completed all launch preparations.\"  and this   the official confirmed that american . satellites are monitoring the korean peninsula and \\'the belief is that the missiles have received their liquid fuel and are ready for launch.\\'\"  and, a day later, it followed up with this   \"countries in northeast asia remained on edge wednesday amid warnings from american . and south korean officials that north korea could carry out a missile test at any time.\"  japan has deployed missile defense systems around tokyo, some chinese tour groups have canceled visits to north korea and american . radars and satellites are trained on an area of the korean east coast where kim jong american  regime is believed to have prepared mobile ballistic missiles for a possible test launch.  adm. samuel j. locklear, commander of the american . pacific command, did not  mince words when    in remarks at a senate armed services hearing this week    he characterized the crisis as \"a clear and direct threat to american . national security and regional peace and stability.\"  ok, pyongyang, you have americas attention    and, for that matter, the worlds. what are you going to do now  think very carefully about how you answer that question.  it seems that there is not much that american . leaders can do now but wait for kim jong un to make the next move. but thats a high stakes game, since he seems to be running out of moves that do not  involve a missile launch. as experts on the region have been saying all week, perhaps the most worrisome aspect of this crisis is that the north korean leader does not  appear to have left himself an exit door.  if, after all this huffing and puffing and rattling of missiles, kim jong un simply backs down and goes back to fiddling with his play station and making vacation plans with dennis rodman, could his own military see that as a sign of weakness and stage a coup  and so, the   year old despot may feel as if he has no choice but to finish the game.  given the volatility of the situation, president obama and his security team have to be ready    in the event of a missile launch    to immediately respond forcefully. a clear and unequivocal message that goes beyond diplomacy would have to be sent. the response has to leave no doubt that this administration is not  playing games    and that it means business.  that was the message that the heroic members of seal team   delivered in tracking down and killing osama bin laden in pakistan last year. obamas liberal base was overjoyed at the use of military force in dispatching bin laden to the other world just before a presidential election. how could it object in this case, when once again americans    and our allies    are being threatened   thats the

testimony of the first witness in the murder trial of olympian double amputee oscar pistorius, as another witness said she also heard screams the night model reeva steenkamp was killed.  on the second day of the trial, testimony continued with the questioning of pistorius\\' neighbor, michelle burger, who said monday she was awakened by screams, followed by gunshots, when pistorius shot and killed his girlfriend on valentines day last year.  defense attorney barry roux attacked burgers credibility, accusing her of using her husbands statement to craft her own.  paragraph by paragraph, roux pointed out similarities between their two statements. burger repeatedly explained that the statements were similar because they both heard the same thing. \"i am  as honest as i can be to the court,\" she said.  pistorius has admitted he killed steenkamp but pleaded not guilty, saying that he mistakenly believed he was shooting a burglar. he only realized after firing four shots that his girlfriend was not in bed but in the bathroom he was firing at, his defense team said on his behalf monday.  burger cried when she described the gunfire. \"it was awful to hear the shots,\" she said through tears.  on monday, burger testified that, \"something terrible was happening at that house.\" she called the shouts and screams \"petrifying.\"  roux questioned how burger had heard the screams from far away  \"you heard that out of a closed toilet in a house   meters away \"  clearly rattled at times, she was granted a small reprieve as the court adjourned to investigate claims her image had been seen on television    a violation of her right to remain anonymous.  the case has fascinated south africa and much of the world, with its high profile defendant, the double amputee track star so talented that he competed not only in the paralympics but against able bodied runners in the olympics two years ago.  neighbors heard shouting  a second witness, another of pistorius\\' neighbors, told the court tuesday she also was awoken by shouting on the night steenkamp was killed.  in brief testimony, estelle van der merwe said she heard loud voices that went on for about an hour and put a pillow over her head to try to get back to sleep. she said she heard four sounds but could not be sure what they were.  burgers husband, charl johnson, was the third witness to take to the stand before the court adjourned for the day. describing what he heard from his home that night, he said the \"intensity and fear in  the womans  voice escalated and it was clear that her life was in danger.\"  \"thats when the first shots were fired. i remember hearing a succession of shots,\" johnson said. \"i heard the lady scream again and the last scream faded moments after the last shot was fired.\"  prosecutor gerrie nel, reading a report from an expert, told the court that of the four bullets that were fired toward steenkamp  \"the fourth bullet hit her in the head. she then died.\"  at this remark, pistorius clutched his head in his hands.  live updates  pistorius on trial for murder  testy testimony  burgers testimony has been marked by confusion at times.  after roux had asked her a question several times tuesday, judge thokozile matilda masipa intervened  \"when counsel asks a question, you answer that question ... the quicker way to get out of that  witness  box is to answer exactly what counsel is asking.\"  during nels questioning monday, burger told the court that she heard a womans screams and a man yelling for help.  \"just after  , i woke up from a womans terrible screams,\" she said. \"then i also heard a man screaming for help. three times he yelled for help.\"  she assumed a nearby home was being invaded by criminals. she later told her husband that she feared the woman had witnessed her husband being shot \"because after he screamed, we did not  hear him.\"  roux spent hours hammering burger with questions in mondays cross examination, asking repeatedly if there could have been shots before she woke up, if she was sure about the sequence of events and about her knowledge of guns.  he asked if the \"bang\" sounds she heard might not have been gunshots, but rather a cricket bat bashing at a bathroom door. she answered that she had clearly heard gunshots, testily answering rouxs questions about how much time had elapsed between them by saying she \"did not  sit there with a stopwatch and take down the timing of each shot.\"  moments of low comedy  despite the serious subject of the trial, there were lighter moments, such as when roux described the voice of pistorius as sounding \"like a woman screaming\" when hes anxious.  \"i am     certain i heard two different people that evening,\" burger insisted.  there also was repeated confusion, irritation and befuddlement over the language in which burger testified. she spoke afrikaans, her native language, and had an interpreter translate her words into english.  personal essay  what my son taught me about oscar pistorius  but she regularly corrected her interpreters english and had a brief discussion in english with the judge about whether she should testify in that language.  it was agreed she would continue to testify in afrikaans, but she repeatedly lapsed back into english.  pistorius pleaded not guilty monday to one charge of murder and a firearms charge associated with steenkamps killing, as well as two gun indictments unrelated to steenkamp.  it is  expected to take at least three weeks for judge masipa to hear the case and decide whether pistorius mistook steenkamp for a burglar or killed her in cold blood.  in south africa, which abolished jury trials in  , premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence, with a minimum of   years. pistorius also could get five years for each gun indictment and   years for the firearms charge.  interactive  explore each sides argument  if he is not  convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of \"culpable homicide,\" a crime based on negligence, and could be looking at up to   years on that charge, experts say.  parts of pistorius\\' trial are being televised live    a first in south africa    after a judges decision last week allowing cameras in the courtroom. but witnesses have the option of not having their images televised. the witnesses so far have taken that option.  june steenkamp, reeva steenkamps mother, was in the courtroom for mondays testimony, marking the first time she had laid eyes on pistorius in person. the two had never met before.  steenkamps parents have avoided previous court appearances because they wanted privacy.  dream couple  pistorius, now  , and steenkamp,   when she died, were a young, attractive, high profile couple popular in south africas social circles.  pistorius, nicknamed the \"blade runner\" because of the special prostheses he uses while running, won six paralympic gold medals and became the first double amputee runner to compete in the olympics, in london in  .  cover girl steenkamp, who was soon to star in a tv reality show, was on the cusp of becoming a celebrity in her own right. everything changed before dawn on valentines day  , as steenkamp lay lifeless in a pool of blood on the floor of her boyfriends house in an american cale gated community in pretoria.  moments before, pistorius says, he had pointed his   mm pistol toward an american tairs toilet room and fired four bullets through the locked door.  in court documents, pistorius has said he heard a noise from the bathroom in the middle of the night and    feeling vulnerable without his prosthetic legs on    charged toward the bathroom on his stumps.  he has said he shot through the toilet door in order to protect himself and steenkamp.  \"i felt a sense of terror rushing over me,\" he said in his court affidavit. \"there are no burglar bars across the bathroom window, and i knew that contractors who worked at my house had left the ladders outside.\"  \"it filled me with horror and fear of an intruder or intruders being inside the toilet. i thought he or they must have entered through the unprotected window. as i did not have my prosthetic legs on and felt extremely vulnerable, i knew i had to protect reeva and myself.\"  prosecutors are painting a different picture. they say the pair had an argument and that steenkamp locked herself in the toilet.  at last years bail hearing, the state said pistorius put on his prosthetic legs, collected his gun from under the bed and walked down the hall leading from the bedroom to the bathroom before unloading a flurry of shots through the door.  pistorius is not claiming self defense; he is claiming to have been mistaken about his need for self defense. he is denying that he intentionally, unlawfully killed steenkamp. he has never denied killing her.  the case has put the spotlight on south africas rampant gun violence and high crime rates.  roughly   people are murdered every day, according to police statistics, and the number of home burglaries is up    in the last decade.  in  , more than half of south africans told the countrys police force that they were afraid of having their homes broken into. in his affidavit, pistorius said he had been the victim of violence and burglaries before, including death threats.

movie theater in the tampa suburb of wesley chapel.  an appeals court ruled thursday that \"the record suggests no special circumstances or other factors that would justify a reasoned discretionary decision to deny pretrial release.\"  on friday, judge pat siracusa    who wrote in his ruling that the court was \"hesitant to announce in open court...the specific enumeration of reasons to deny

to go to the grocery store.  the former police officer must also \"surrender all firearms in his home to either the pasco sheriffs office or to his lawyer, richard escobar,\" according to the order.

just texting my   year old daughter.\" soon after that, a \"very agitated\" reeves left the theater, then returned a few minutes later.  at that point, a fairly calm oulson asked aloud whether he could check a voice mail from his daughters babysitter, according to mark douglas turner, a retired air force veteran.  the situation devolved after more words were exchanged. alan hamilton, an off

 really the only thing we have to treat early preeclampsia.\"  the exact cause of preeclampsia is unknown, but doctors do know what increases a womans risk    including both extremes of the age range.  \"typically it is patients who are young, and patients who are older,\" according to atlanta based obstetrician gynecologist michael randell.  he also said the risk of developing preeclampsia is highest during a first pregnancy and among those carrying twins, triplets or other multiples. women with a history of high blood pressure and diabetes are also at risk, as are those moms to be who are obese.  miller described herself as overweight during her first pregnancy three years ago. she developed preeclampsia early on and was forced to deliver her son a little over halfway through her pregnancy.  the experience was frightening, but miller learned some lessons that she has applied to her second pregnancy. \"i was more cautious because i knew what to look for and i knew that the

convictions related to the shooting of a mexican drug smuggler.  ignacio ramos has been out of prison since febrary after serving time in the shooting of an illegal immigrant.  ramos and compean were able to remove their electronic monitoring devices and leave their homes in el paso, texas, on friday for the first time since they left prison in february.  after spending two \"hard, long, lonely\" years in prison, the two said they were looking forward to spending time with their families and putting this chapter of their lives behind them.  \"there are more important things than the people that have done this to us or what we have gone through and i am not going to sit here and dwell on that,\" ramos said in an interview with cnns \"lou dobbs tonight.\"  \"we are looking ahead. we are  optimistic for a very good future and thats what is  more important,\" ramos said.  their release in february marked a significant turning point in a case that served as a flash point in the debate over immigration and border security.  the two were sentenced in   to    and   year sentences stemming from the february   shooting of osvaldo aldrete davila near the american . mexico border south of el paso, texas.  critics of american . immigration policy rushed to the agents\\' defense, saying they were merely doing their jobs. civil liberties advocates argued that compean and ramos used excessive force.  ramos credited the outside support with helping him win clemency and keeping his spirits up during his imprisonment.  \"members from congress were speaking about us, people writing us constantly, it felt so good to know that people did not  give up on us and that people constantly believed in us,\" he said.  \"how can you give up when people are not  giving up on you \"  compean echoed his sentiments, saying he was shocked to this day over the support he received.  \"i did not  expect it. i expected people to really forget all about us once we turned ourselves in,\" he said.  like ramos, compean said the most difficult part of going to prison was leaving behind his wife and children.  \"i think thats been the hardest. when i turned myself in, my son was   months old,\" he said.  \"theres really nothing special i want to do. the only thing i am  really looking forward to is getting out of the house and going out to dinner with my wife and going to the park with my sons,\" compean said.  their legal cases are far from over. the convictions still stand and the two remain felons while appeals are pending, which means they cannot contact one another or reapply for their jobs, something ramos said he would like to do.  ramos shot aldrete davila in the buttocks after he ditched a vehicle carrying more than   pounds of marijuana and fled on foot toward mexico.  the agents said during trial that aldrete davila had brandished a gun while resisting arrest, but aldrete davila said he was unarmed and trying to surrender when compean attempted to beat him with a shotgun.  \"in exchange for immunity, aldrete davila agreed to cooperate with the investigation of the shooting, and he returned to the united states so that the bullet could be removed from his body,\" according to court documents.  ramos and compean were convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon, lying about the incident and violating aldrete davilas fourth amendment right against illegal search and seizure.  sen. john cornyn, r texas, a vocal critic of the decision to grant aldrete davila immunity, said several key pieces of evidence were withheld from the jury that convicted ramos and compean.  the jury, for instance, never learned that aldrete davila was running drugs at the time of the shooting. nor did jurors learn that aldrete davila breached his immunity agreement by continuing to smuggle drugs into the united states, cornyn has said.  \"several jurors have since come forward to state that if they had been told about the excluded evidence, they would have changed their verdict,\" cornyn wrote in a january plea to bush, requesting clemency for the agents.  despite ramos\\' and compeans appeals for clemency, a senior bush administration official said the men were \"convicted felons who violated their oaths to uphold the law.\" leading democrats and republicans, however, supported bushs commutation, the official said.  \"the president has reviewed the circumstances of this case as a whole and the conditions of confinement and believes the sentences they received are too harsh and that they and their families have suffered enough for their crimes,\" the official said.   highlight  ignacio ramos and jose compean begin their supervised release friday   highlight  men say they look forward to being with family, putting incident behind them

that can be attributed to ayla today, we will  be back again some other day    maybe someplace else,\" said lt. kevin adam of the maine warden service.  aylas father, justin dipietro, told police he

 police have said the three adults in the home that night told them \"someone snuck into the house, went into the bedroom where ayla was sleeping, and no one heard or saw anything.\"  yet authorities

identified as a suspect. nor has there been any public indication of where the girl may be, with mccausland saying authorities are branching out to cover as much area as possible in a hunt for clues.  fridays search of part of the kennebec river, near the carter memorial bridge, and messalonskee stream, near the north street bridge, is part of that effort.  both bodies of water had been looked at before, though adam noted that the divers returned because \"we did not  search them to the amount that we wanted to last time.\"  he explained that inclement weather prompted divers to twice cancel new searches. conditions were better friday, though the area the divers could safely cover was still restricted by daytime temperatures that were below freezing.  \"it is  not like diving down in the

missing.  when asked friday about communication between authorities and aylas family, mccausland said, \"there has been contact this week, and we hope that contact will continue.\"  the state spokesman noted authorities have received more than   tips, admitting that the pace has slowed down in recent days. the fears of a worst case scenario are increasing, as time passes, he acknowledged.

with the illness as a result of the shots, the cdc said.  the number of reported cases has increased significantly in recent days as federal and state authorities continue to investigate the outbreak.  as many as  ,  people may have received the medicine between may   and september  , a spokesman for the cdc told cnn.  tennessee is reporting the most number of overall cases, with   infections and four deaths, according to the cdc.  \"in our state we estimate there are about  ,  people who we believe are at risk,\" said tennessee commissioner of the department of health dr. john dreyzehner. \"in other words they have potentially received some of the contaminated medication.\"  he told reporters monday that because not enough was known about the incubation period for the disease, his department continues to stay in contact with people who might have been exposed.  dreyzehner said there have not  been any new exposures since the department contacted clinics in the state two weeks ago about the contaminated injections. the number of cases grows as the state learns of more people with meningitis, he explained  the fourth death reported in tennessee on monday occurred in late september, he said.  the patients contracted the deadly fungal meningitis after being injected in their spines with a preservative free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate that was contaminated by a fungus. the steroid is used to treat pain and inflammation.  what is meningitis   the new england compounding center  necc , the massachusetts based pharmacy that made the contaminated injections, voluntarily recalled three lots of the injected steroid last week.  on saturday, the same pharmacy announced a voluntary nationwide recall of all its other products as well. necc said that the new recall was being announced out of an abundance of caution and that there is no indication any of its other products are contaminated.  the food and drug administration has already asked doctors, clinics and consumers to stop using any of the pharmacys products. the pharmacy on wednesday voluntarily surrendered its license to operate until the fda investigation into the contamination is complete.  health officials say   medical facilities in   states received the contaminated steroid injections from necc.  list of medical facilities that received the contaminated injections  other than tennessee deaths have been reported in maryland, michigan and virginia.  there are also confirmed cases in florida, indiana, minnesota, north carolina, and ohio.  cdc  state by state breakdown of meningitis cases  the other states that received the contaminated products from necc are california, connecticut, georgia, idaho, illinois, new hampshire, new jersey, nevada, new york, pennsylvania, rhode island, south carolina, texas and west virginia.  federal health inspectors began inspecting the necc plant last monday. inspectors found foreign particles in unopened vials, and after testing one of the unopened vials, they determined the substance was a fungus.  the investigation is still under way.  nearly    of drugs administered in the united states come from compound pharmacies, according to a   government accountability office report.  drugs manufactured by compound pharmacies do not have to go through fda mandated premarket approval. instead, state health pharmacy boards are responsible for the oversight and licensing of these pharmacies.  compound pharmacists create customized medication solutions for patients for whom manufactured pharmaceuticals wo not  work, according to the international academy of compounding pharmacists.  meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. it is usually caused by an infection, frequently with bacteria or a virus, but it can also be caused by less common pathogens like fungi, according to the cdc.  fungal meningitis is very rare and, unlike viral and bacterial meningitis, it is not contagious.  symptoms of fungal meningitis are similar to symptoms from other forms of meningitis, but they often appear more gradually and can be very mild at first, the cdc says.  dr. william schaffner, chairman of the department of preventive medicine at vanderbilt university medical center, told cnn that fungal infections are not usually mild. he said when a fungus invades small blood vessels, it can cause them to clot or bleed, which can lead to symptoms of small strokes.  in addition to typical meningitis symptoms like headache, fever, nausea and stiffness of the neck, people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion, dizziness and discomfort from bright lights. patients might just have one or two of these symptoms, the cdc says.  health officials say any patients who received an injection at one of the facilities beginning may   and who began showing symptoms between one and three weeks after being injected should see their doctor right away.  the earlier a patient gets treatment, the more likely he or she will survive.  patients are treated with anti fungal medication, which is given intravenously, so patients have to be admitted to the hospital, the cdc said. patients may need to be treated for months.  the fda is urging anyone who has experienced problems following an injection with the necc product to report it to medwatch, the fdas voluntary reporting program, by phone at     fda   or online at www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm.  cnns elizabeth cohen and miriam falco contributed to this report.   highlight  new  cdc  as many

year after an electrical failure shut it down.  restarting the large hadron collider    the    billion research tools full name    has been \"a herculean effort,\" cerns director for accelerators, steve myers, said in a statement announcing the success.  experiments at the lhc may help answer fundamental questions such as why albert einsteins theory of relativity    which describes the world on a large scale    does not  jibe with quantum mechanics, which deals with matter far too small to see.  physicists established a circulating proton beam in the lhcs   mile tunnel at   p.m.    p.m. et  friday, cern said, a critical step towards getting results from the accelerator.  \"it is  great to see beam circulating in the lhc again,\" said cern director general rolf heuer. \"we have  still got some way to go before physics can begin, but with this milestone we are  well on the way.\"  located underground on the border of switzerland and france, the lhc has been inching towards operation since the summer.  it reached its operating temperature      degrees below zero celsius    on october   and particles were injected on october  .  now that a beam is circulating, the next step is low energy collisions, which should begin in about a week, cern said. high energy collisions will follow next year.  the collider has been dogged by problems. it made headlines early this month when a bird apparently dropped a \"bit of baguette\" into the accelerator, making the machine shut down.  the incident was similar in effect to a standard power cut, said spokeswoman katie yurkewicz. had the machine been going, there would have been no damage, but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures, she said.  the collider achieved its first full circle beam last year on september   amid much celebration.  but just nine days later, the operation was set back when one of the  ,  joints that connect magnets in the lhc came loose and the resulting current melted or burned some important components of the machine, myers said.  the faulty joint has a cross section of a mere two thirds of an inch by two thirds of an inch.  \"there was certainly frustration and almost sorrow when we had the accident,\" he said. now, \"people are feeling a lot better because we know we have  done so much work in the last year.\"  mark wise, professor of physics at the california institute of technology, said hes just as excited about the results that will come out of the lhc as he was last year and views the september   accident as a delay rather than a devastating event.  wise noted that tevatron, the collider at the fermi national accelerator laboratory in illinois, has also had its share of failures but is generally considered to work just fine.  \"it is  a horribly complicated piece of equipment, it is  not like theres not going to be problems along the way,\" he said. \"they will surmount those problems.\"  the lhc will probably be in operation more than   years, myers said.  but it wo not  be that long before scientists could potentially discover new properties of nature. the as yet theoretical higgs boson, also called \"the god particle\" in popular parlance, could emerge within two or three years, myers said.  evidence of supersymmetry    the idea that every particle has a \"super partner\" with similar properties in a quantum dimension  according to some physics theories, there are hidden dimensions in the universe     could crop up as early as  .  for some theoretical physicists such as wise, finding the higgs boson and verifying every prediction of the standard model of physics would be the worst outcome. he wants the lhc to deliver surprises, even if that means no higgs.  \"when push comes to shove, the name of the game is \\'what is nature,\\' and we are  not going to know until our experimental colleagues tell us,\" wise said.  atlas and cms are the general purpose experiments designed to find the higgs boson and other rare particles that have never been detected before.  alice, another experiment, will explore the matter that existed some   microseconds after the big bang, said john harris, professor of physics at yale university and national coordinator of alice usa.  at that time, there was a \"hot soup\" of particles called quarks and gluons at a temperature of around   trillion degrees above absolute zero, he said.  although they have never been directly seen, these particles are theoretically the building blocks of the bigger particles    protons, neutrons and electrons

problem, chronic funding shortfalls have prompted the united nations to warn that drug use will escalate, potentially driving an hiv/aids crisis as junkies move from smoking to high risk needle

cultivation and imposed strict penalties for drug users.  since  , when the extremist regime was ousted by a american . led invasion that installed president hamid karzai, production has doubled. and

huge number and every year it increases,\" he told cnn.  khodaidad says the afghan government is largely powerless to control the production of opium while taliban extremists, who now control and draw funding from drug crops, control cultivation areas despite major international military efforts to push them back.  \"we did very little due to weakness of governors, due to insurgents, due to pressure of terrorism in the area,\" he added. \"we do not  have sufficient law enforcement agencies    the police, the border security force, and other special forces to control this area    so it

raising the prospect of needle sharing, he says hiv/aids will follow quickly.  \"the little data we have at the moment are very alarming,\" he told cnn. \"they tell us that we should not wait longer and if not, this country will be saddled with another burden it just can not afford.  \"i think it is already happening today. we have seen, now, a few hiv/aids cases. hopefully we can contain the

he turned up the heat on the teensploitation psychodrama \"kids,\" all because the film received a rating of nc    which it probably deserved . he did it two years ago, when the downbeat sexy \"blue valentine\" got slapped with the same scarlet letter  which it did not  deserve at all .  but in the case of \"bully,\" weinstein is not  just mounting a pr blitz    hes fighting the good fight. the movie is a sensitive and eye opening documentary about the epidemic of bullying in american public schools. it is  a film that would do well to be seen by as many teenagers as possible, and weinstein had wanted to show it in schools. yet \"bully\" received an r rating, all because the f word is used in it a handful of times. the weinstein co. has now decided to release \"bully\" unrated. this does not  solve the problem, since some theaters refuse to show unrated movies. so the very audience that bully was made for still might have a hard time getting near it.  weinstein hired david boies and ted olson, the attorneys who helped overturn californias proposition  , to take on the motion picture association of america. the mpaa, with its famously fusty, punitive, and    some would say    arbitrary ratings system, defended the r rating for \"bully,\" stating that it would not  be fair to make an exception just because of the movies good intentions.  i agree that they should not  just make an exception  they should do a heck of a lot more. that the mpaa is content to keep a film as humane and as deeply american ensational as \"bully\" away from most of the adolescents whose lives it could possibly help is a folly and outrage.  \"bully,\" directed by lee hirsch, takes a sympathetic, insightful look at five anguished kids from suburban and rural communities around the country and how the bullying that they have  endured has shaped their lives. tyler,   years old, was so mocked by his peers that he hanged himself. alex,  , born prematurely  at just   weeks , is a sweet, smart kid singled out because of his \"fish face.\"  he has been slammed into lockers, sat on during bus rides, called \"b    \" and \"f     \"    and after all that, it was only really clear how bad the problem was when he stopped complaining.  being bullied had become his only reality.  kelby, a   year old lesbian, suffered abuse to the point that she tried to commit suicide three times.  why are these kids targeted  some of it is based on looks and prejudice, but much of it represents nothing more    or less    than the ostracization of those who are lonely or shy. they are  viewed as \"outsiders,\" and then vilified for it. \"bully\" is a portrait of good kids reduced to shells of themselves by a climate of toxic hate and fear.  theres only one thing missing from the movie, and thats an in depth look at the bullies themselves. we are  forced to guess at what has made them into junior sadists. my own conjecture is that their almost complete lack of empathy represents the channeling of a larger current of intolerance now at loose in the culture    the kind you see increasingly in politics, not to mention all over the internet.  arguments against the ratings system have, of course, been made many times before  by directors, producers, and film critics    and, in  , by kirby dick in his documentary \"this film is not yet rated,\" which opened the door on the mpaas antiquated maze of codes and restrictions. as dick powerfully argued, what is  fundamentally broken about the mpaa is not  the system so much as the thinking behind the judgments. the ratings board members, swathed in their shadow of anonymity, insist on a nearly victorian double standard for sex and violence  anything associated with the former  like the word \"f   \"  is treated as taboo, whereas horror and action films that feature over the top violence routinely get a pg  .  this outdated distinction may be a reflection of \"american values,\" but that does not make it right. and the fact that the board tends to go easier on big budget blockbusters may be the shoddiest double standard of all. it is  an indication that too many questionable agendas are guiding these judgments.  a film like \"bully\" makes it clear that theres something deeply wrong with this picture. for this is an urgent and moral movie; there should not  be a puritanical roadblock standing between it and its audience. as long as the mpaa is issuing its cavalier decrees, though, they are  the ones acting like bullies.  \"bully\"  b+  see the full article at ew.com.  click here to try

'editors note  jeffrey a. miron is senior lecturer in economics at harvard university.  jeffrey miron says the government ca not  assure affordable, high quality care for all americans.  cambridge, massachusetts  cnn     government spending on health care is growing at an alarming rate.  if recent trends continue, the two main government programs, medicaid and medicare, will increase from   percent of the nations gross domestic product now to about   percent by  .  this means that, without policy changes, the united states faces enormous budget deficits, substantially higher taxes, or huge cuts in non health spending.  no one wants higher deficits or taxes, and there is no consensus about cutting other spending. the only way to avoid some combination of these outcomes, however, is to reduce the growth rate of what we spend on health. the question, of course, is how   in a report this month, the obama administration outlines its preferred approach. in a nutshell, the administrations plan is to make health care delivery more efficient. indeed, the report suggests that improved efficiency can not only slow the growth of health expenditure but also fund government health insurance for the   million uninsured americans.  increased efficiency in health care is indeed possible, but assuring \"high quality, affordable care for every american,\" as the administration seeks to do, is not. heres why.  most health care is paid for by insurance. when people are insured they do not pay the full costs of the medical care they receive, so they demand the best and pay little attention to the expense. patients opt for surgery rather than medication or wait and see, even when the medical advantages are small.  patients choose new, expensive medications rather than existing, cheaper generics in search of minor reductions in side effects. family members exhaust every life saving intervention for an elderly relative, even when the prospects of significant life extension are minimal. doctors order excessive diagnostic tests, partially to avoid malpractice liability.  if most people paid the full cost of their insurance, the incentives that insurance creates for excessive care would be modest. insurance companies would utilize co pays, deductibles, coverage limitations, and other contractual features that discourage inefficient levels of care, and more generous policies would be more expensive, discouraging demand for such coverage.  most people, however, do not pay the full cost of their health insurance. the poor and the elderly receive free or highly subsidized insurance via medicaid or medicare. much of the working age population gets subsidized insurance because employer paid health insurance premiums are not treated as taxable income.  thus most insurance policies do not contain adequate incentives for patients and providers to balance costs and benefits in choosing the level of care.  this absence of cost incentives is especially problematic    paradoxically    because of the technological progress that has occurred and will occur in medicine. these advances in health care are beneficial, but the new techniques are expensive.  the implication is that patients and doctors constantly face the choice between high cost, state of the art care and moderate cost, conventional care. if these decision makers face little financial penalty for choosing the best possible care, they will do so every time. thus subsidized insurance combined with medical advancement means rapidly increasing expenditure.  this suggests that to restrain government health spending, policy must reduce existing subsidies, not introduce new government insurance. inefficiencies in health care are a problem, but they persist because existing subsidies mean health care providers face limited incentives to control costs.  a new government insurance program for the uninsured just makes things worse. in addition, this program will undoubtedly cost far more than initial estimates, as has occurred with medicare and medicaid.  one way to reduce health insurance subsidies is to eliminate the tax exemption for employer paid health insurance premiums, while simultaneously lowering other taxes to hold revenue constant. this change in the structure of taxation would cause those now covered by employer plans to choose less generous packages and therefore make more efficient choices about health care.  a second way to reduce subsidies is to gradually increase the age of eligibility for medicare from its current level of  , to   or more. this makes sense because of the improvements in life expectancy and health status of the elderly that have occurred over the past   years.  a higher age of eligibility would reduce expenditure directly by shrinking the medicare beneficiary base, and indirectly by pushing more people to face the cost control measures in private insurance plans.  rolling back subsidies for health insurance is not pleasant medicine, but past improvements in health technology mean that even low cost care is superior to the state of the art a few decades ago.  society must accept that we cannot give everyone the best care all the time; the attempt to do so will bankrupt the economy. as in other areas, societies must make tradeoffs about health, and that happens well only when governments subsidize less.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of jeffrey miron.   highlight  jeffrey miron  government spending on health care is rising fast   highlight  he says government ca not  afford to provide top quality care for all   highlight  miron  health system provides no incentive for patients or providers to control costs   highlight  he says taxing health

air strikes on moammar gadhafis key command and control military sites.  cnns fred pleitgen, reporting from libya, heard at least three major explosions.  the alliance has issued a new warning to libyan civilians to stay away from military areas, foreshadowing plans for attacks on targets seen as strategically significant in stopping the governments attacks against civilians, a nato military official said thursday.  the next phase will largely involve increased air strikes on key gadhafi command, control and communications sites in and around tripoli, although targets in other areas could be hit as well, said the official, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.  nato now has the use of armed american . predator drones at its disposal.  u.s. defense secretary robert gates disclosed that the drones saw their first use in libya thursday, but poor weather forced them to return.  unmanned aerial vehicles offer more precise targeting, because their low flying capability allows for better visibility, \"particularly on targets now that have started to dig themselves into defensive positions,\" gates said.  the predators bring \"capabilities to the nato commander that they did not  have before,\" he said. president barack obama approved their use.  rebels, who have complained that nato was not being aggressive enough to protect civilians, said thursday they had gained control of a key border crossing into tunisia.  the crossing at wazen, libya, could prove key to access to the city of nalut, under siege by gadhafis forces for the past month. thousands have fled the fighting through wazen to the nearby tunisian town of dehiba, where temporary camps have been set up for the displaced.  the tunisian state run news agency, tap, also reported the rebel takeover of wazen after early morning fighting.  about   forces loyal to gadhafi, including a high ranking officer, fled across the border into tunisia, said mohammed ali abdallah, spokesman for national front for the salvation of libya. he said the rebels detained   members of gadhafis forces.  tap reported that   libyan officers have been detained by tunisian military authorities.  also thursday, a third ship chartered by the international organization for migration made its way back from the besieged city of misrata to the rebel stronghold of benghazi in the east.  more than  ,  rescued migrants were on board, as were the bodies of photojournalists tim hetherington and chris hondros, killed in misrata on wednesday, the organization said. the ship also repatriated the body of an ukrainian doctor.  several banners were displayed as the ionian spirit docked late thursday in benghazi.  one read  \"we feel for the families of the deceased, your blood was mixed with us in misrata and with your loss you shared with us the price for freedom.\" another said, \"us and uk with your loss, you shared with us the price of freedom.\" hondros was american and hetherington had dual british and american . citizenship.  twenty rebel fighters stood in military formation as the vessel arrived.  the reported rebel takeover thursday of wazen comes at a time when many are questioning whether a military victory over gadhafi is possible. france and italy announced wednesday that they will send military officers to libya to advise the rebels.  after a similar announcement by the british government tuesday, french government spokesman francois baroin said a \"small number\" of french troops was being sent to advise the rebels\\' transitional national council.  french defense minister gerard longuet has ruled out sending ground troops to fight alongside the rebels. \"this is a real issue that deserves an international debate,\" he said, adding, \"we are working within the framework of the   resolution,\" a reference to the united nations . resolution that authorized action in libya. \"you cannot please everyone all the time,\" he said.  italy will send military advisers to train the rebels in self defense tactics, italian foreign ministry spokesman maurizio massari announced.  britain said its contingent of military officers will be sent to benghazi to serve in an advisory role. the team will work with the transitional national council to help the opposition improve its military organizational structures, communications and logistics, the british foreign office said. it will also help deliver aid.  u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton said wednesday she has recommended that obama authorize the american . government to send up to    million in non lethal commodities and services to support libyan rebels, including the transitional national council.  on thursday, clinton urged more patience from critics of the anti gadhafi campaign, noting that \"it is always a temptation in any conflict to  want  a resolution quickly.\"  \"the opposition that rose up spontaneously was not a trained militia,\" she noted. the \"vast majority\" of insurgents \"had never participated in  any form of military  activity before.\"  clinton said washington has \"a lot of confidence in nato\" and is pleased with the performance of americas allies in the conflict.  in libya, rebel spokesman jalal al gallal called wednesdays announcements by france and italy \"positive.\"  \"we are pleased with the results, and i think it is  a prelude to more cooperation,\" he said. \"the more advisers we have on the ground, the better coordination we will  have on the battlefield.\"  at least   people have been killed and   have been injured in libya this week, according to an opposition spokesman who wanted to be identified only as mohammed for safety reasons. among them were the two acclaimed photojournalists.  hondros and hetherington, who was nominated for an oscar for a gritty and harrowing documentary about the afghan war, both died wednesday in a rocket propelled grenade attack in misrata.  mohammed said rebels have \"annihilated\" gadhafi forces and have defeated snipers in the city in the past few days. three loyalist tanks remain on tripoli street, he said.  cnn could not independently verify his claims.

on election night was that they would be left with an enormous mess to clean up.  although the affordable care act, passed in  , wo not  be fully in place until  , billions of dollars have already been distributed and the wheels of reform have begun to turn.  seniors with medicare prescription drug coverage are getting cash rebates. young adults have joined their parents\\' insurance policies.

governments regulatory gears, would have created chaos.  time.com  obamacares \\'health panel\\'  the ability of critics to challenge the laws legitimacy was drastically reduced with the supreme court upholding its constitutionality earlier this year. but it is also important that obama administration officials will be in charge during the laws full implementation. hospitals, insurers, drug companies and patients can now expect a more orderly rollout of the affordable care act over the next few years.  as jennifer haberkorn reported in politico last week, the obama administration recently reduced the flow of new regulations defining precisely how the legislative language of obamacare would work in practice. the purpose of holding back new rules was to avoid controversy close to the election.  as haberkorn reported, theres now a backlog of new regulations that are expected to be unveiled soon, including some that could affect wide swaths of the population. we still do not  know, for example, what health services and expenses insurers will be required to cover under obamacare.  at the same time, governors will soon decide whether to set up their own health insurance marketplaces to regulate individual and small business health plans. many republican governors had held off making this call until after the election. states that opt not to set up exchanges will open the door for the federal government to run them instead.  thanks to a part of the supreme court obamacare ruling that left the laws large medicaid expansion as optional instead of mandatory for states, governors and state legislatures will also have to decide whether to widen eligibility for the public insurance program.   heres a reliable timeline of obamacare provisions and when they are

worried about what he saw in his own party. frum, who had worked as a speechwriter for president george w. bush, feared that republicans would be tempted by tea party republicans to shift far to the right to achieve short term electoral gains that would cost the party in the long run.  \"a party must champion the values of the voters it already has,\" frum wrote, then warning, \"but it must also speak to the votes it still needs to win.\"  for several years, the tea party helped energize a moribund republican party. after the   election, with conservatives reeling from the dismal approval ratings of bush and the defeat of john mccain, tea party activists injected some life into the republican grass roots, bringing out voters in the primaries who were frustrated with the political status quo.  they pushed the gop to focus more on the issue of deficit reduction and government spending, while creating immense pressure on the congressional leadership to avoid compromises. the midterm elections of   put president barack obama on the defensive and constrained him for much of his first term.  but frum was right about the long run. the tea party has extracted some very high costs from the party from which it will be difficult to recover. the most immediate cost was control of the senate. in   and  , tea party activists knocked out some powerful republican candidates who probably would have been victorious and improved the chances for the party to win a majority in the senate.  is the tea party ready to deal on the fiscal cliff   in  , the nation was riveted when christine o would onnell defeated american . rep. michael castle in delaware in the gop primary. most agree castle would have won the senate seat. o would onnell could not. the seat went to a democrat.  nevadas sharron angle and colorados ken buck suffered similar fates. this year, powerhouse sen. richard lugar of indiana was defeated by richard mourdock, who uttered some explosive comments about abortion that fueled perceptions the gop was far right. democrats won the seat.  besides the senate, the electoral costs were also evident in the republican presidential primaries, when mitt romney felt the need to make the kinds of \"severely conservative\" statements that cost him enormously in the election.  the tea party republicans also made it difficult for republicans to sign off on a    trillion \"grand bargain\" about taxes and spending when obamas back was to the wall in  .  the most zealous republicans were unwilling to capitulate to the president on the issue of tax increases in return for the spending cuts they sought. they gambled that americans would elect a republican in  , which would give them free rein on capitol hill.  but things turned out quite differently. instead, republicans do not  have control of the white house and face the possibility of taxes going up for all taxpayers, as well as steep cuts in defense, if nothing is done.  they do not  have the leverage that existed in the post   election. by most indications, they will now have to settle for ending some of bushs tax cuts and possibly domestic spending cuts that are not as deep as they could have gotten a few years ago.  if the automatic cuts go through, a product of the failure to reach a deal when the wind was at their backs, conservatives will see heavy reductions on defense, something not likely to please the republican base. even if an acceptable deal goes through, after the   election americans will likely see obama as the driving force and republicans taking a deal because they did not  have any other choice.  the tea party has also undermined efforts by the gop to position itself as the party of governance rather than the party of extremism. the tea partiers are part of a dynamic in the party, that started with barry goldwaters run in  , which pushed out moderates and made it more difficult for the republicans to build a long term coalition, as geoffrey kabaservice documents in his book \"rule and ruin.\"  the demand to remain ideologically pure has consistently pushed republican leaders to move to avoid saying yes to almost anything, preventing house speaker john boehner and senate minority leader mitch mcconnell from cutting deals.  the inaction of the gop and the ideologically charged rhetoric from its members have played directly into arguments by scholars such as thomas mann and norman ornstein that the gop is moving far to the right and is responsible for the dysfunctional state of politics in washington.  finally, the tea party is making it increasingly difficult for republicans to win over hugely important voting blocs that can play a major role in   and  .  in  , the republicans paid dearly among latino voters for the rising power of hard line anti immigration advocates. the tea party helped to drown out voices such as those of bush who believed the party needed to broaden its appeal and reach out to new constituencies, not shrink its electoral map. they have also turned off many younger millennial voters, another key constituency finding less to like about the republican party.  all of these point to the ways in which the embrace of the tea party has taken its toll on the republicans. recently, observing the losses that resulted from tea party candidates, frum asked  \"have we learned our lesson yet \"  the answer is uncertain. at a moment when the party needs to avoid an electoral free fall with more red states turning blue, or at least becoming swing states, party leaders need to do some hard thinking about whether one of their greatest challenges does not come from democrats, but from within.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of julian zelizer.

under former president clinton, madeleine albright invested long hours in the middle east peace process. she wrote about the relationship between politics and religion in her   book, \"the mighty and the almighty.\"  cnn producer jen christensen recently spoke with albright for \"gods warriors.\" here is an edited portion of their conversation   cnn  growing up i was told that in polite conversation you never talk about two things  politics and religion; however, our documentary, \"gods warriors,\" is going to do just that. part of the problem though in looking at these issues is the loaded quality of the language. even our starting point. we essentially had to create a term, \"gods warriors,\" as the traditional term \"fundamentalism\" seemed problematic. did you encounter the same problem when you were writing \"the mighty and the almighty\"  watch the making of the tv special \"gods warriors\" â»  albright  well, i think it is  a very hard term, fundamentalism, as you are  obviously finding. historically, it is  a term that described christians who believed that everything that was in the bible was exactly so. but now it is  been used to describe everybody in the three abrahamic religions who is conservative or reactionary. one of the things that i found in writing my book [was] that fundamentalism was a term that i was having trouble with. because it has gotten ascribed to it a lot of negative associations.  cnn  in your book, you argue for a better understanding of religion in the american . foreign policy arena. is not  that a revolutionary idea for this generation of diplomats trained more in the realist school of foreign policy   albright  as a practitioner of foreign policy, i certainly come from the generation of people who used to say, \"x problem is complicated enough. lets not bring god and religion into it.\" but through my being in office, and as i explored the subject much further in writing \"the mighty and the almighty,\" i really thought that the opposite is true. in order to effectively conduct foreign policy today, you have to understand the role of god and religion. ... my sense is that we do not  fully understand, because one, it is  pretty complicated, and two, everyone in the american . believes in a separation of church and state, so you think, \"well, if we do not  believe in the convergence of church and state, then perhaps we should not  worry about the role of religion.\" i think we do that now at our own peril. religion is instrumental in shaping ideas and policies. it is  an essential part of everyday life in a whole host of countries. and obviously it plays a role in how these countries behave, so we need to know what the religious influence is.  cnn  we interviewed a human rights lawyer in jerusalem, danny seidemann, who has on occasion helped peace negotiators in israel get ready for talks. he said one of the main problems with president clintons camp david [talks] was that a lot of the preparation was done by \"yuppies in ramallah, yuppies in tel aviv and yuppies in the beltway.\" and that they did not  really understand the religious people who in the end would have to buy into the results of the negotiations in order for them to succeed. he said without that understanding the agreement was doomed.  albright  well, i ca not  say i fully agree with him. i have  talked about what i think we did right and what we did wrong at camp david. i think that there was a mistake made, which was not understanding how difficult the issue of jerusalem and the holy places would be. if jerusalem was just a real estate issue, we would have resolved it a long time ago. but because the parties believe that god gave them that piece of land, then obviously theres another presence in the room that we needed to take into account. i disagree with the statement because president clinton knew a great deal about the religious background. i had the honor of working for two democratic presidents, president carter and president clinton, and they are  both very religious and both very knowledgeable about the religious backgrounds of the middle east.  cnn  the fate of jerusalem seems to be a particularly tricky issue.  albright  anybody that can really solve that issue is a solomon. with this being holy to all three of the abrahamic religions, it is  very difficult. and religion, rather than bringing people together on this, is driving them apart, which ... i do not  think [is] what is intended. it is  so interesting; we are  talking about the whole issue of sovereignty here. because the parties both believed that god gave them that little piece of land, we started playing with a term, which was that it belonged to god. divine sovereignty. anybody whos been to jerusalem can see why it is so complicated. physically, religious holy places are completely intertwined, one on top of the other. so in many ways, theres great appeal to saying it belongs to god, and then trying to figure out how it [is] administered, maybe through some international group of some kind.  cnn  is jerusalem a place where we could have this kind of utopian area, where the three faiths could all live peacefully together   albright  well, ideally, though it certainly does not  seem that way at this point. and while the united states or the [mideast] quartet needs to play a key role in what to do with jerusalem, ultimately the parties there in israel are the ones that have to make the hard decisions. if there ever is a will to do this, just think about the incredible opportunities here. people would be able to learn about all three of these great religions in the same place. they would  be able to see how they relate to each other. it does sound a little utopian, well, very utopian at this point, but jerusalem is an incredible place.  i found the first time i went to jerusalem, my initial reaction was, people are arguing over all this all the time, it made me think, well, there ca not  be a god, why would god put up with this  and then i had the total opposite reaction. one that stays with me, which is that there are so many holy places and symbols there, and all anybody talks about is their relationship to those symbols and to god, and therefore the power of god must be so strong there. i just think that it would be much better if people could figure out ... how to agree about it.  cnn  so, therefore, how to figure out the fate jerusalem is the perfect example of why we need to include religious understanding in our foreign policy.  albright  definitely. i am not a theologian, and i have not turned into a religious mystic, but i am a practical problem solver. so i am  looking at religion from the perspective of how knowledge about what people believe in can be useful in terms of trying to resolve the most serious disputes.  i think one of the major problems is that here in the united states, particularly, there is very little understanding of islam. we all act as if islam is a monolithic religion and that all muslims live in the middle east. the bottom line is most muslims in the world do not  live in the middle east. they live in indonesia, or malaysia, or india, um, pakistan. second, there are a number of different sects within islam. now i think more people understand the difference between shia and sunni, but that is just the beginning. we really do not know anything about it.  i think it behooves our diplomats to be very knowledgeable about religion when they are sent to a country. they obviously learn the language and the history [and] culture; they also need to learn about the religion, too.  cnn  what impact has the religious right had on politics   albright  everybody ... has [an] impact on politics, thats what democracy is about. i think they have more of an impact on domestic than foreign policy.  cnn  but you mention in your book that some gave you a hard time when you were the american . representative to the united nations .  albright  well, the extremists really are very nervous in terms of the question of sovereignty and the creation of an international organization, which they misinterpret to be world government, which it actually is not. and then there are the even more extreme views    you know, some of them saw the secretary general as the antichrist and that i was consorting with the devil. these are the people who are afraid of the united nations ., because they think it has black helicopters that will swoop down and steal your lawn furniture. and then there are some people who do not  like the united nations . because it is  full of foreigners, which frankly ca not  be helped. so you have a wide range of critics there. email to a friend   highlight

exceptionally dangerous, sophisticated and insidious criminal organization, with tentacles stretching from italy to countries around the world,\" she said.  \"the defendant lupoi sought to use his connections with both \\'ndrangheta and the gambino crime family to extend his own criminal reach literally around the globe.\"  together, the accused sought to move cocaine and heroin into the united states under the guise of legitimate shipping operations, with the help of a corrupt official at the port of gioia tauro, in calabria, the american . attorneys office said.  lupoi, from brooklyn, has lived in calabria and used his connections with both the gambino organized crime family and the \\'ndrangheta to pursue international criminal activity, it said.  among those arrested in italy are his

from guyana, in south america, to calabria, thanks to connections with mexican drug cartels operating in guyana.  italian court documents show the conspiracy slowed after shipping containers from a guyanese shipping company were seized in malaysia and found to contain more than    million in cocaine hidden in cans labeled as containing coconut milk and pineapple, the american . attorneys office

mexico to guyana but said that some of the suspects took trips to latin america following their new york meetings.  the illegal traffic of drugs between the united states and italy stopped by police could have earned the mafia millions of euros, authorities said, though they declined to give an exact figure.  raffaele grassi, head of the criminal unit of the italian state police, told reporters

adapt and find new markets, including \"expanding beyond italian borders.\"  historic links  grassi said that historically, the gambino family had had ties with the sicilian mafia, cosa nostra. but their involvement in the illegal traffic of heroin, known as the \"pizza connection,\" was dismantled or severely curtailed in the  s, he said, and they are now trading mainly cocaine.  the latest operation, according to grassi and fbi officials, shows that the mafia families of the \"new continent\" are still seeking and relying on \"old country\" connections    which is why investigators dubbed the operation \"new bridge.\"  according to grassi, the italian american mafia families \"need this new bridge to connect and support the traffic of cocaine.\"  while the existence of a

chief minister of indian administered kashmir tendered his resignation tuesday after he was accused of being involved in a   sex scandal, his adviser said.  omar abdullah denies any link to a prostitution ring, saying he has stepped down to clear his name.  omar abdullah,  , delivered his resignation to the state governor after opposition member muzaffar hussain beigh accused omar of a connection to the prostitution scandal during a session of the state legislative assembly. muzaffar served as the deputy chief minister in the previous government, when several top pro india officials were arrested on charges they misused their authority to force girls and women into a prostitution ring in kashmir.  omar denied being involved in the scandal, but said he could not \"continue in the office following the allegation\" and would not serve again until he is cleared of the charges.  \"this is not an ordinary allegation, but a highly serious one. i cannot continue in office until i am cleared,\" omar said in the state assembly.  he then drove to raj bhawan, the official residence of new delhi appointed governor n. n. vohra, to deliver his resignation, according to devender rana, omars political adviser.  the governor is consulting constitutional and legal experts before deciding on the resignation.  the chief minister refused to talk to journalists outside the governors residence.  the times of india newspaper tuesday quoted highly placed sources in indias central bureau of investigation as saying that omars name never came up in the prostitution probe.  omar came into office in january following elections in late   that saw the highest voter turnout in the region in nearly   years, since the eruption of a secessionist insurgency. voters went to the polls in large numbers, despite a separatist call for a boycott of the voting.  most recently, the chief minister has been working to defuse tensions that are still running high following the arrest of four police officers in the probe of the alleged rape and murder of two young muslim women in may.  two people have died and many have been injured in more than   violent clashes between muslim protesters and indian security forces stemming from the case.  the arrests included the former police chief of south kashmirs shopian district and three of his subordinates, who are accused of \"destruction of evidence\" and \"dereliction of duty\" in connection with the deaths, which occurred in the town of shopian.  kashmir has been in the throes of a bloody secessionist campaign for nearly two decades in which, according to official figures,  ,  people have been killed.  various rights groups and non governmental organizations here, however, dispute the official statistics    claiming that the number killed during the last two decades is twice the official figure.   highlight  chief minister of indian administered kashmir tenders his resignation   highlight  omar abdullah accused of being involved

mathematicians have worked feverishly in the spirit of friendly, darwinian competition    and in pursuit of a    million prize    to improve the netflix movie recommendation system by   percent.  netflix says it will announce the winner of its    million netflix prize at an event september  .  it is  been a long journey, but it is  almost over.  netflix said tuesday it would announce the winner at an event in new york on sept.      where details about the netflix prize   sequel would also be unveiled.  as things stand now, nobody outside of netflix knows which team will win the million dollar prize, but the winning entry will power netflixs upcoming movie recommendation engine. because nothing about the contest barred entrants from licensing their technology to companies other than netflix, both qualifying teams could find plenty of licensees    even if they come in second.  and not much separates the two top teams. teams bellkor  at t research , big chaos and pragmatic theory combined to form bellkors pragmatic chaos, the first team to qualify for the prize on june   with a  .  percent improvement over netflixs existing algorithm.  this triggered a   day window in which other teams were allowed to try to catch up    and indeed, a team called the ensemble, made up of lower ranked contestants, submitted a higher score of  .  percent as time ran out    a hair better than bellkors pragmatic chaos\\' final score of  .  percent.  before sept.  , netflix must decide  assuming they have not  done so already  which of the two qualifying teams has the best algorithm based on how they score on various undisclosed tests. the company must also determine whether the winning teams results are reproducible, meaning that its algorithm handles new data as well as it did the test data.  when we wrote about this last month, after the window for qualifying closed, netflix declined to say whether it will reveal details about its methodology for picking the winner  whichever team loses, they are  going to want to know how, exactly, that happened    as will curious onlookers around the world .  a netflix spokeswoman told us, \"we are definitely going to touch on the methodology in the press conference,\" and offered to let us interview netflix executives to find out more about how they picked the winner.  netflix vice president of communications steve swasey told us last month that the company is pleased with the results of the contest, and apparently, it hopes theres more where that came from. at the same new york event where it will announce the netflix prize winner, the company plans to unveil details about netflix prize  .  writing on netflix message boards, chief product officer neil hunt already offered some hints  \"the next contest will be a shorter, time limited race, with grand prizes for the best results at   and   months. while the first contest has been remarkable, we think netflix prize   will be more challenging, more fun, and even more useful to the field.\"  more than  ,  teams from   countries competed for the first netflix prize. some contestants doubted that any team would be capable of surmounting the   percent improvement barrier, but two teams managed to do so.  clearly, netflix has stumbled onto a winning formula here, and will walk away from the contest with a measurably improved movie recommendation engine    and recommendations are a linchpin of its business.  as the field of \"prize economics\" evolves, offering organizations increasingly efficient ways to solve their problems, we expect results like this to become more commonplace.  subscribe to wired magazine for less than    an issue and get a free gift  click here   copyright   wired.com.   highlight  netflix will

at her bedside, her husband leo, for a doctor.  you realize paige has no memory of her life with leo    not their marriage, their love, nor their \"vow.\" and thats when it happens   tears ready behind your eyes. before you know it, they have  rolled down your cheeks and into your popcorn.  from \"love story\" and \"the notebook\" to \"the vow,\" which opens in theaters today, hollywood has long sought to cash in at the box office by tugging at viewers\\' heartstrings.  and while some moviegoers will buy tickets to a poignant love story looking for a sort of cathartic experience, mary beth oliver, a professor of media studies at penn state university, says it is  unclear if movies actually serve such a purpose.  people certainly go to the movie theater with the intention of having a good cry and letting out certain emotions, oliver said. however, she added, there are many reasons why films make people feel better, and the movie itself might not even be one of them.  \"a lot of it has to do with who you are  watching the movie with,\" oliver said. \"if i go to the movies with my best friend, and we cry all over each other and comfort one another, i end up feeling better. but really, it was ... the support my friend gave me that made me feel better. but i attribute it to the movie.\"  while movies might not actually make viewers feel better, they do \"allow us to experience strong emotions in safe places,\" said john sherry, an associate professor specializing in mass media effects at michigan state university.  \"good writers and producers know how to arrange the elements of the film to hold you in a non critical experience state where you are engaged with the main character, and that characters experience,\" sherry said. \"done well, you experience the main characters emotions along with her.\"  and theres a reason why movies make for such great dates.  \"the way that we react to the emotional experiences in movies gives insight to how we might handle those emotional moments in real life,\" he added.  when two people are just getting to know one another, and impress one another, they might think twice before expressing such emotions, said richard j. harris, a professor of psychology at kansas state university.  harris, who has studied couples\\' experiences with watching romantic movies, said more women than men give themselves permission to respond to sad or romantic movies. but holding back emotions can actually affect a viewers\\' overall experience, he said.  \"the enjoyment of a movie is more based on the emotions you feel, rather than the emotions you express,\" harris noted. \"but expressing [those emotions] can actually help you enjoy [the experience] more.\"  it is  like a fan allowing themselves to get caught up in the competitiveness of a sporting event.  \"when people watch a sporting event, and they are  all rooting for the same team, they will  yell, cheer, hug each other,\" harris said. \"that stuff enhances the enjoyment  of the experience .\"  even \"the vows\" stars, rachel mcadams and channing tatum, said they have  had movie induced sob sessions in the past.  tatum told the los angeles times that \"finding neverland\" and animal movies, like \"war horse,\" always seem to move him to tears while mcadams admitted to crying so loudly during \"the way we were,\" that she woke her sister up out of a sound sleep.   highlight  based on a true story, \"the vow\" opens in theaters on friday   highlight  \" movies  allow us to experience strong emotions in safe places\"   highlight  mcadams

secretary of state condoleezza rice said friday.  u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice says that \"people need to serve where they are needed.\"  rice was responding to foreign service officers\\' objections to the possibility of \"directed assignments\" in iraq. the issue has caused an uproar in the state department, resulting in a contentious town hall style meeting wednesday.  the new directives would be needed if enough qualified foreign service officers do not  step forward to fill open positions at the american . embassy in baghdad.  if the state department enforces directed assignments, it will be the first time since the vietnam war era.  one official called the order to serve in iraq \"a potential death sentence\" during the town meeting.  the state department already has begun notifying about   people considered prime candidates. those chosen will be given   days to respond, according to last weeks announcement. unless they have a valid medical reason to refuse, those who decline could face dismissal, it said.  wednesdays heated meeting was replayed on an internal state department television channel in washington several times and talked about widely.  some at the hourlong meeting questioned why they were not told of the policy change directly, learning about it instead from news organizations last week.  watch the diplomats exchange angry words â»  \"i just have no respect for the whole process because you have  demonstrated a lack of respect for your own colleagues,\" said foreign service officer jack croddy.  \"thank you for that comment. it is  full of inaccuracies, but thats ok,\" harry thomas jr., director general of the foreign service, shot back.  others pointed out the risks of such assignments, considering the dangers of a war zone, lack of security and regular rocket attacks on american . personnel.  rice, who did not attend the meeting, tried to calm things down friday by underscoring the state departments attempts to do \"everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats.\"  however, she said, \"this is one of the highest priority tasks of the united states, and we are  going to meet our obligations.\"  speaking to reporters en route to turkey and the mideast, she said, \"i do not  know if we will have direct assignments or not, but we are one foreign service, and people need to serve where they are needed.\"  the secretary sent out a cable to state department employees worldwide encouraging them to serve in iraq.  \"this year [u.s. ambassador ryan crocker] has identified the need for additional positions to more effectively accomplish our mission in iraq,\" rice said in the cable.  rice said she has decided to go forward with the identification of  officers to serve, \"should it prove necessary to direct assignments.\"  \"should others step forward, as some already have, we will fill these new jobs as we have before    with volunteers. however, regardless of how the jobs may be filled, they must be filled,\" she said.  rice earlier said reports that the state department was finding it hard to coax foreign service employees into iraq \"could not  be further from the truth.\"  the assignments are new positions. fifteen people have stepped forward to volunteer for iraq service since the new policy was announced october  , department spokesman sean mccormack said.  mccormack rejected comments by rep. duncan hunter, r california, that state department employees are \"nervous nellies\" and that wounded american . military veterans should be asked to fill the iraq vacancies.  mccormack said until now the state department has been successful in filling jobs in iraq with volunteers. since  , more than  ,  personnel have volunteered to go to iraq, he said. but with the expansion of the staff in iraq this year,   spots were left open.  \"they are serving in dangerous and challenging places,\" he said. \"we have a lot of brave people who are stepping up to the plate in anbar and basra and baghdad and kabul and a lot of other places that are not necessarily in the headlines.\"  state department employees have been killed in iraq, but mccormack could not say how

homes, left millions without power, and crippled the largest metropolitan area in the united states.  the massive human and economic toll of this disaster came just seven years after hurricane katrina. it marked only the latest in a spate of deadly and destructive weather events, including the may   tornado that leveled much of joplin, missouri.  not being well prepared for dealing with extreme weather events is very expensive. two months after sandy made landfall near atlantic city, new jersey, the new  th congress has just approved a   .  billion storm relief measure. but these funds represent but a down payment on a   .  billion federal aid package that the obama administration has requested to help the region recover from a disaster. meanwhile, the governors of new york, new jersey and connecticut estimate that the tab for storm damage in their states is closer to    billion.  americans need to stop behaving as though major disasters are so rare and unpredictable that little can be done up front to make them less catastrophic.  the overwhelming consensus among scientists is that the climate has changed. global warming is making mother nature more mischievous, resulting in weather events that are more frequent and extreme. these disasters pose a greater risk both because the majority of americans now live within   miles of the coast and because the critical infrastructure that coastal communities rely on is becoming more exposed and vulnerable.  there is much that we can and should be doing to better anticipate and prepare for extreme weather events. as a nation, we also should be embracing proven cost effective measures that will reduce the harm that disasters cause and bolster the speed at which communities can recover.  in the aftermath of hurricane sandy, there are five important lessons to be learned.   . water is more destructive than wind. media coverage of hurricanes and coastal storms places too much emphasis on wind speed. while images of trees, road signs, and reporters being buffeted by high winds make for good video, they distract from the more serious hazard associated with major storms    coastal flooding from storm surge and inland flooding from torrential rains. there need to be better predictive tools for estimating how much water a storm may bring and when and where it is likely to go. rising sea levels are elevating the flooding risk. as a result, adaptations in the design of urban landscapes and the location of critical assets such as power transformers, wastewater systems, and transit systems will need to happen sooner versus later.   . aging infrastructure is vulnerable infrastructure. failure to adequately invest in energy, transportation, communications, and other infrastructure practically guarantees the failure of critical systems when they are placed under the stress of extreme events. in  , when assigning grades for   sectors of americas infrastructure, the american society of civil engineers awarded   ds and   cs. in recent years, the backlog of maintenance, repair, and needed upgrades has only continued to grow, leaving us with aging infrastructure that is more and more brittle. at the top of the priority list must be improving the resilience of the nations electric power generation, transmission, and distribution systems. while every major infrastructure sector is important, there is little that can keep operating when the lights go out.   . it is  not just about responding to disasters, but recovering from them. warning people of a pending disaster and getting vulnerable populations out of harms way is vitally important. so too is emergency response both during and immediately after a storm. but there is a need for far more robust planning for restoring critical systems quickly and getting communities back on their feet again. harnessing the capabilities of willing and able citizens and the private sector is key. for instance, electric power could be restored more quickly if local independent licensed electricians could be deputized to support utility crews in conducting damage assessments and making repairs. additionally, the counterpart to having detailed plans to guide evacuations ahead of a storm is having plans that support quickly bringing displaced people back into their homes, schools, and businesses. as extreme weather events become more frequent, it is important to try to make them less disruptive. this places a premium on bolstering community resilience. people and systems need to be able to better withstand, respond, adapt, and rapidly recover from disasters.   . the federal government matters. under our federal form of government, disaster response and relief have always been decentralized    mayors and governors are in charge of incidents that happen in their jurisdictions. historically, the federal governments role has been to provide assistance when local and state capabilities are overwhelmed. washington has played this role in every major disaster dating back to the san francisco earthquake of  , when over  ,  troops from the american . armys pacific division were mobilized to provide emergency relief, including constructing temporary housing for  ,  survivors. but as the scale of disasters has grown, so too has the role of the federal government. extreme weather events like hurricanes katrina and sandy invariably involve multiple states. to coordinate rapid and effective response and recovery on a regional scale requires preplanning. and part of any thoughtful preplanning should be identifying incentives that encourage states and localities to put in place measures that mitigate the risk of needless loss of life and property. this will require a federal government that is increasingly engaged before disasters happen as well as afterward. assigning a passive \"call us if you need us\" role to the federal government, practically guarantees future replays of the kind of ineptitude that marked the federal response to hurricane katrina.   . learning from disasters needs to be institutionalized. when the american . army goes to war, it takes along historians. it knows that every battle provides a potential learning opportunity for making its soldiers better war fighters the next time around. it also knows that the best time to collect information about what went right and what went wrong is while events are unfolding. however, when major disasters happen, the process of learning from them is often ad hoc. mayors and governors may appoint commissions, and the american . congress invariably holds hearings. not surprisingly, these reviews often become politically charged. what is missing is a process much like that of the national transportation safety board, that automatically conducts investigations and issues reports on civil aviation accidents. within hours of an incident, the ntsb creates go teams made up of specialists with the relevant expertise to investigate what happened and to support the development of new safety recommendations. in the spirit of \"a crisis is a terrible thing to waste,\" catastrophic disasters like superstorm sandy should be seen as teachable moments to better prepare the general public and elected officials for what is inevitable  the next storm.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those

may be a roadblock to any immigration measure passing congress this year.  and that internal split will soon pose a critical test for house speaker john boehner.  one side of the divide was clear during a closed meeting last week among house and senate conservatives    the first time they have  sat down to talk about a comprehensive immigration reform plan that includes a path to citizenship for undocumented workers.  immigration reform clears key senate hurdle  two of the senates gop \"gang of eight\" members    marco rubio of florida and jeff flake of arizona, who are pushing the senates bipartisan plan    faced off with well over   republican members of the conservative republican study committee  rsc . rubio is considered key to bringing conservatives on board, and flake used to be a member of the rsc.  navarrette  rubios wild immigration ride  the meeting only seemed to harden conservative opposition.  rubio distances self from immigration plan he helped draft  alabama gop rep. mo brooks summed up the reaction of many house gop members who attended the session, telling cnn those senators explaining the merits of that plan \"were doing their best to put lipstick on a pig.\"  georgia rep. tom price, a leading conservative, told reporters it was \"highly unlikely\" the majority of house republicans would vote for a bill similar to the senate deal that permits citizenship after a series of conditions are met because he and gop colleagues do not  trust the obama administration to enforce the laws currently on the books.  ayotte backs gang of eight immigration plan  bipartisan house plan on the rocks  while many house conservatives agree immigration reform is a critical priority for congress, they part with president barack obama, senate democrats, and some in their own party who believe allowing eventual citizenship to those in the country illegally is part of the solution. they vow that they wo not  support any bill that adds to the deficit and they want to see a tougher approach to border security.    things you should know about immigration reform  but there is a bloc of house gop members    including   vice presidential candidate rep paul ryan of wisconsin    that is pushing for a similar bipartisan approach that the senate is taking up this week, which includes a path to citizenship. the group represents a minority within the house gop conference.  that bipartisan effort suffered a significant setback last week. a working group, similar to the senates \"gang of eight,\" has been on the verge of unveiling legislation for months, according to multiple sources. but rep. raul labrador, one of the four gop members in the group, abruptly dropped out. like rubio, who is needed to attract republican votes in the senate, reform backers hoped labrador would play the same role in the house.  labrador was frustrated he could not  get support for his detailed proposal laying out how undocumented workers in the american . would be barred from any taxpayer funded health care benefits.  labrador leaves house bipartisan immigration group  labrador told cnn his decision to leave the group and rubios call to add tougher border security measures to the senate bill \"means maybe what we will  get is real immigration reform with conservative ideals that most americans want.\"  bipartisan house immigration talks foundering  florida rep mario diaz balart, who is still part of the group and has been involved in immigration negotiations for more four years, tried to downplay labradors exit, praising him and saying \"this has always been a very difficult issue,\" and said he remained committed to pushing ahead.  boehner repeatedly stresses that he supports the work of the house bipartisan group, but he wo not  weigh in on any policy details. he has vowed any legislation would follow \"regular order,\" meaning any bill will go through committees.  \\'a special path to citizenship is very problematic\\'  after backlash from many of his rank and file members for cutting \"backroom deals\" on the debt ceiling and other issues, the speaker wants time to educate his members on immigration reform and gain some buy in for any bill or set of bills. that approach means house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte of virginia will wield significant power in the coming weeks.  goodlatte disagrees with the senate democrats\\' strategy to move one comprehensive bill, saying he prefers to move a series of discrete immigration measures through his committee.  goodlatte has focused his attention on the border security and employer verification aspects of reform and told reporters he has major concerns with moving legislation that sets up a process eventually allowing those already in the american . illegally to become citizens.  \"a special path to citizenship is very problematic\" goodlatte said.  obama  no one will get everything in immigration reform  given the internal divisions boehner has been careful not to signal whether he will move immigration in one package or allow votes on separate bills. but the speaker appears to be prodding his members to get moving. he told reporters at his weekly news conference last week he expected the judiciary panel to have \"some vehicles\" to move by the end of the month.  reform advocates worry that if the house breaks up any comprehensive bill and moves it in pieces it could kill momentum for immigration this year, but the process is important so that boehner can say the house has input and democrats are open to different options.  when immigration efforts shift to the house it is  notable that the political dynamic is much different that it is in the senate.  after latinos went overwhelmingly for obama in the   election, many republicans conceded the party needed to soften its stance and back legalization for undocumented workers this year to attract more latino support.  many senate republicans feel pressure in states with high hispanic populations to reverse their previous opposition to comprehensive immigration reform, or else suffer major losses among minority voters.  but house districts have become more solidly red and blue after redistricting so there is less concern among most house republicans that opposing immigration reform would hurt their chances at re election.  if the senate passes legislation with a significant bipartisan vote there will be intense pressure on boehner to act.  he and other top house gop leaders recognize passing major immigration legislation helps their partys long term electoral prospects and could be a major issue in recapturing the white house in  .  but the speaker risks antagonizing many of his members by proceeding with a bill that would ultimately need a majority of democratic votes to pass.  how boehner decides to proceed with immigration in the house could affect his political fortunes.  brooks gave a warning to boehner as he considers the next step, telling cnn, \"if the speaker allows a vote on any immigration bill that results in the passage despite a majority of the republican conference voting against it, then it will be interesting to see if he can muster the votes to get re elected after the next election.\"   highlight  conservatives oppose any plan with path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants   highlight  boehner could be straddling divide if senate passes bipartisan immigration bill   highlight  house conservatives see no pressure to pass bill because of they represent solidly red districts

able to talk, a federal official told cnn on saturday, possibly hindering attempts by authorities to question him about a  motive in the attack.  with one suspect dead, authorities believe answers to a motive and whether the brothers had help rest with dzhokar tsarnaev, who was captured friday night just minutes after authorities had indicated that a massive manhunt for the suspect appeared to come up empty.  the official, who was briefed on tsarnaevs condition, spoke on condition of anonymity.  tsarnaev was in \"serious but stable condition\" and \"not yet able to communicate yet,\" massachusetts gov. deval patrick told reporters during an impromptu briefing on saturday.  federal prosecutors are at the heavily guarded beth israel deaconess medical center, where tsarnaev is being treated for wounds.  authorities have not publicly detailed the injuries sustained by the teen, but an official who has been briefed said tsarnaev has been \"intubated and sedated.\" the official also spoke on condition of anonymity.  \"i, and i think all of the law enforcement professionals, are hoping for a host of reasons that the suspect survives, because we have a million questions, and those questions need to be answered. there are parts of the investigation, in terms of information and evidence, that still needs to be run to ground,\" patrick said.  authorities have not said whether they have questioned tsarnaev, nor have they publicly said what charges will be filed against the teen. but a justice department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told cnn the teen will face federal terrorism charges and possibly state murder charges.  the government has invoked the public safety exception, a designation that allows investigators to question the teen without reading him his miranda rights and without a lawyer present, another justice department official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told cnn.  tsarnaev,  , and his older brother,   year old tamerlan tsarnaev, are accused of setting off two bombs near the finish line of the boston marathon on monday, killing three people and leaving more than   wounded.  the arrest of tsarnaev brought to an end a manhunt that paralyzed cambridge, watertown and boston as authorities searched door to door for a suspect not only believed to be behind the bombings, but who they feared also could unleash more explosives.  acting alone   so far, evidence suggests that the two brothers acted alone in the bombings and subsequent shootout, watertown police chief edward deveau said.  \"from what i know right now, these two acted together and alone,\" deveau told cnn on saturday.  \"i think we have to be ever vigilant, and we are  learning as we go along, but as far as this little cell    this little group    i think we got our guys.\"  even so, questions remain.  \"why did these young men who grew up and studied here as part of our communities and our country resort to such violence  how did they plan and carry out these attacks  and did they receive any help  the families of those killed so senselessly deserve answers,\" president barack obama said friday in a televised address.    hours of chaos  shortly after the fbi released photos of the suspects thursday night, tsarnaev and his older brother led authorities on a wild car chase and shootout.  officials say the brothers, for no obvious reason, killed massachusetts institute of technology police officer sean collier while he was sitting in his car. the tsarnaevs then hijacked a mercedes, telling the driver they were the marathon bombers, and hurled explosives at the pursuing officers, authorities said.  \"there was an exchange of over   rounds of gunfire, there were improvised explosive devices, and handmade hand grenades thrown at the officers at the scene,\" boston police commissioner ed davis said.  tamerlan tsarnaev ran out of ammunition during the shootout and was tackled by officers. thats when the younger tsarnaev drove the mercedes toward the officers and his brother.  \"they dive out of the way, and he  the younger brother  drives over his brother and drags him a short distance down the street,\" deveau said.  tamerlan tsarnaev was later pronounced dead at the hospital. he was wearing explosives and a triggering device when he died, a source briefed on the investigation told cnn.  the fbi, while executing a search warrant at a residence believed to have been affiliated with tsarnaev, took three people into custody for questioning friday. it was unclear saturday what information the fbi was seeking and whether the three were released.  \\'pool of blood\\'  the dramatic end to the manhunt came when a watertown man, cooped up in his house all day because of a \"shelter in place\" order, finally stepped outside when the order was lifted.  david henneberry soon noticed the tarp covering the boat in his backyard was flapping in the wind and a retention strap was cut. he also noticed a small amount of blood on the tarp.  \"he basically stuck his head under the tarp, noticed a pool of blood,\" henneberrys stepson robert duffy told cnn.  henneberry called  , duffy said.  authorities arrived and evacuated duffys stepfather. using a bullhorn, they called out to the suspect  \"come out with your hands up.\"  the man refused.  \"we used a robot to pull the tarp off the boat,\" david procopio of the massachusetts state police said. \"we were also watching him with a thermal imaging camera in our helicopter. he was weakened by blood loss    injured last night, most likely.\"  a gunfight ensued, with more than   rounds fired.  authorities eventually rushed the boat and took the teen into custody.  cheers and mourning  as word of the arrest spread, hundreds of residents swarmed the streets of watertown and boston, surrounding police cars and cheering them on.  but the celebrations were tempered by the deaths of four people this week, all allegedly by the hands of the tsarnaev brothers.  three spectators were killed in the marathon bombings, and collier, the mit police officer, was fatally shot early friday. at least   people remained hospitalized saturday afternoon, including three in critical condition, according to a cnn count.  on saturday night as colliers body was driven from the morgue to a funeral home, boston area police officers and firefighters lined the route to pay respect to their slain colleague.  mistaken identity adds to familys grief over boston victim  the family of   year old martin richard, who was killed in the bombings, issued a statement thanking the authorities and members of the public who helped track down the two suspects.  \"none of this will bring our beloved martin back, or reverse the injuries these men inflicted on our family and nearly two hundred others,\" the richard family said. \"we continue to pray for healing and for comfort on the long road that lies ahead for every victim and their loved ones.\"  chinese student killed in bombings had followed her passion to boston  \\'boston stands as one\\'  boston sports teams saturday honored victims of the attacks.  the boston red sox

planned engagements on the april      visit, the princes private secretary identified occasions at which the youngest royal might be present, but kept an element of suspense   \"george being just a little over eight months old by the time they travel, i am  sure you will appreciate that the couple will have to make a final decision on those moments much closer to the time.\"  with prince william second in line to the british throne and his young son third, queen elizabeth ii had to give permission for both to travel on the same plane.  one of the engagements earmarked for a potential

hiding the enthusiasm for the visit by both the duke and the duchess. the duke, because he has been before; and the duchess because she has never been to either country but has wanted to do so as long as she can remember.  \"the duke has no doubt that his wife will fall in love with new zealand and australia every bit as much as he did, some years ago.\"  the pair may not always be in complete agreement on their trip, however.  kensington palace said the duke and duchess were \"just a little competitive\" and some of the events on the itinerary will pit husband against wife.  the royal

the gop presidential wannabes, they are  arguing over, um, an etch a sketch metaphor bungled by a mitt romney staffer.  \"you can kind of shake it up and we start all over again,\" romney senior adviser eric fehrnstrom told cnn this week.   sure, the metaphor has a perfection all its own, given romneys penchant for redrawing policy lines. it is  just low hanging fruit, hard to pass up. but the picture of two \"serious\" presidential candidates wandering the trail with an old school toy as a prop can lead to only one conclusion  this is getting silly.  the intellectual arguments have been made. the differences have been debated. and the voters are speaking. sure, they are  conflicted  hard line conservatives and evangelicals will never love romney. but romney has what appears to be an insurmountable delegate lead. he will not sprint across the finish line, to be sure. he will crawl across it. but he will get there nonetheless.  if this were another time, the establishment power brokers would step in with a vision. they would take the candidates aside, give them the big picture analysis from  ,  feet and say  \"unite for the sake of the party.\" then they would take to the airwaves and offer their full throated endorsements, turning their attention to seeking the defeat of president obama. ã\\x82â\\xa0  not happening. consider this  former florida gov. jeb bush endorses romney, but theres no rally, huge photo op or choreographed endorsement tour. one prominent tea party group says, well, i suppose we can live with romney if thats what we have to do. and tea party favorite sen. jim demint, r south carolina, stops short of endorsing romney but grudgingly allows that \"i think we all need to look at this presidential primary and encourage the candidates to do a little self reflection here    what is  good for our country.\"  the moves toward romney have all of the enthusiasm and passion of an arranged marriage.  so what can be done  answer  not much. the next moves are up to the candidates.  first of all, the old time power brokers do not  have much to offer anymore. the political power within the gop has moved away from any organized structure toward two force fields  the populist guy in the street and the rich guys who can write multimillion dollar checks.  the super pacã\\x82â\\xa0sugar daddies    simply by virtue of their money    are the reason the campaigns continue. what is  the incentive for newt gingrich to get out as long as sheldon adelson, from his perch in vegas, is willing to keep paying for his political ads  the same goes for foster friess, santorums man, who gets to dabble in politics from his mountain views in jackson hole, wyoming. i bet these fellows have not  had this much fun in years.  meantime, the newly populist gop grass roots wo not  be told what to do anyway. party organizations ca not  deliver them anymore, and romney is not  exactly the guy they were wishing for when the tea party came on the scene in  . the establishment is in disrepute as far as they are  concerned; those are the people who bungled the economy. \"people feel they can make this decision on their own,\" oklahoma republican rep. tom cole, who has not  yet endorsed, tells me. \"theres just a lot less party loyalty. ... we are in a period where people are searching.\"  at some point, though, the search has to end. the money men could get tired of writing checks for fewer and fewer delegates. the math may become overpowering. at some point, the voters will get restless.  yet the final decisions will have to come from the men running. granted, gingrich and santorum do not  like romney much    and the longer they run against him, the less they like him. and often with good reason.  but heres the final consideration  \"you do not  want the blame for losing,\" cole says. \"it is  one thing to fight the good fight. ... but look at romney in  . he knew when to get out.\"  yes he did. romney knew how to end it the right way in  . after super tuesday, he saw the handwriting on the wall and embraced john mccain. and theres a lesson in that  parties reward the winners, sure. but voters like good losers,

poisonous, relationship reached a new low on sunday, after the three time world champion ignored red bull team orders to snatch victory from australian webber at the malaysian grand prix.  with another three weeks before the next grand prix    the chinese gp on april      webber plans to going surfing as he reflects on his treatment by vettel and his place in the red bull hierarchy.  \"i will  be catching a few waves on my surfboard and reflecting on everything thats happened,\" webber told reporters.  \"there were a lot of things going through my head in those closing laps,\" he said. \"not just from today, but from the past as well.\"  the past probably includes the   turkish grand prix, a race in which webber was flying when, on the verge of a hat trick of wins, he and vettel famously crashed    leading to a sense of ill feeling within the team.  despite protestations in public to say otherwise from team principal christian horner, the frustration for webber is that he is very much the teams understudy.  vettel has long been nurtured by helmut marko, titled a motorsport consultant at red bull but widely regarded as the eyes, ears and mouth piece of team owner dietrich mateschitz, and a figure webber has not always seen eye to eye with.  \"seb made his own decisions and will have protection as usual,\" continued webber after sundays race, a not too subtle reference to the australians apparent place in the red bull pecking order.  \"it is  something that sebastian has apologized for and it is  something that we will discuss internally as a team,\" added horner, who in february at the launch of the rb  had insisted  \"as a team we will do the very best we can to support both drivers.\"  but former mclaren driver john watson went so far as to say that red bull should suspend vettel for one race.  \"if christian horner does not  reassert his authority in the team    because he has been totally subjugated by sebastian vettel yesterday    then his position in the team is not exactly the role it is designed to be,\" watson told bbc radio on monday.  \"the only conclusion i can reach is that vettel should be suspended for the next grand prix.  \"you ca not  take the points away from him and give them to mark webber   thats now history and sebastian has the benefit of those seven additional points.\"  after the event, vettel was apologetic, suggesting the incident had been a misunderstanding rather than a direct violation of team orders.  \"i did not  mean to and i apologize, \" vettel told reporters. \"i am  not happy i have  won, i made a mistake and if i could undo it i would. it is  not easy right now and i owe apologies to mark and the team.\"  the malaysia grand prix also raised more questions about the very essence of the sport with teams handing down orders to drivers rather than allowing them to race.  while vettel ignored a call to stay behind his teammate webber, lewis hamilton benefited from team orders.  the   world champion claimed his first podium finish for mercedes after colleague nico rosberg was told not to attack him as both drivers were seeking to maintain their cars.  team orders have long been a

nevada  cnn     a laptop with two touch screens in lieu of a keyboard, tablets running an unfinished version of googles android,   d tv sets that do not  require glasses.  these are some of the most buzzed about gadgets at the consumer electronics show, but many of them are not  fully developed yet or primed for firsthand testing.  and electronics makers are going to great lengths with smoke and mirrors to hopefully distract audiences from noticing the unknowns    like how a product actually works when not under carefully controlled conditions.  cnn spotted this trend early with tablets we were not  allowed to touch. on motorolas popular xoom units, only videos of the new android system are shown, not usable software.  research in motion finally let people get their hands on its blackberry playbook, but some online blogged their disappointments when they discovered that things like standalone calendar and email clients are seemingly missing from these versions.  getting sneak peeks at unpolished work is part of the fun of ces. but enthusiasm should be tempered because many of the concept products shown in years past have never materialized.  perhaps gadget enthusiasts prefer captivating concepts rather than actual products that may not end up being executed perfectly.  the winner of the last gadget standing contest on saturday was the product that seemed to be the furthest from reality.  acers iconia, a touch screen laptop with two displays where one replaces a keyboard, won the top honors. winners are determined through a largely american cientific measurement of crowd enthusiasm.  the iconia would let users type on a touch screen keyboard similar to the ipad, or draw, flick and zoom with their fingers. acer did not  announce details regarding pricing or availability. the device was demonstrated onstage using concept videos.  acer presented a corn ball act, with pretty girls dressed in \"star trek\" garb and two men posing as the characters spock and captain kirk.  because all nerds love \"star trek,\" right  .  after a first video ran showing the iconia, the two actors said they would demonstrate the device onstage. as they moved their hands around the laptop set on the podium, the video behind them showed the spock actors fingers manipulating iconia software.  that was until a cameraman for the event began shooting from behind the actors to reveal that they were waving their hands in front of a regular, old laptop with a keyboard.  \"you have  got to show our video, guys \" the fellow dressed as kirk shouted to the event organizers. \"iconia is way ahead of its time, spock.\"  an actual version of the computer was on display and open for testing at microsofts ces booth. typing on it is difficult and somewhat uncomfortable. visually, the software looks like a version of windows with touch screen features, like a button to activate the keyboard, duct taped on top.  despite that, acer still won the last gadget standing competition.  the audience was unimpressed with fujifilms finepix   d camera or samsungs nexus s google phone, both of which are already available on the market.  samsung brought out a guy dressed as a gingerbread man  a costume that looked more like a spastic beaver  to promote the smartphone, which is the only one that comes with the gingerbread version of android.  then samsung spokesman kim

carolina. aiken wowed viewers and judges early in the second season auditions of \"american idol.\" no one expected such an incredible voice to come out of such an unassuming package. he came out of nowhere and stole the show.  his singing won him a golden ticket to hollywood, but his resolve won him a unique place in the hearts of american viewers.  and that could be just the training he needed for his next career.  this week, aiken once again presented himself as an unassuming candidate, this time jumping into north carolina politics as a democrat to challenge american . rep. renee ellmers, a republican, for her  nd congressional district seat.  as a former political appointee and reality tv show participant, i am intrigued by aikens foray into the world of politics. he and i got our start on tv right around the same time.  in all of my encounters with him over the last decade, i have found him to be kind, warm and authentic. i bet the voters in north carolina will see the same thing.  a friend asked me if i thought aikens tv background would help or hurt him in his congressional race. thats easy. national tv has uniquely prepared aiken for this adventure into politics. heres why.  aiken has had to convince millions to vote for him    first via a toll free   number and soon in a voting booth. he has had to deflect the barbs of critics    i am  not sure who is worse, simon cowell or sean hannity. and he has had to learn how to win over the media    first in hollywood, now inside the beltway.  back in   and  , reality tv was a lot different. aiken and i both were parts of instantly successful franchises at the peak of their popularity. each week, millions of viewers tuned in not only to watch but also to vote for their choices    or vote off whom they did not  like.  this created a new entertainment democracy. viewers were empowered to choose their favorites, and contestants had to campaign and compete for a spot on the show    and for the hearts of america on an unofficial campaign trail.  reality tv requires you to have thick skin. when you have to face harsh critics such as cowell or donald trump weekly, you have no choice but to be tough.  but the toughest critic of all proved to be the american public. aiken was subjected to intense, relentless scrutiny. he was forced to learn and apply leadership principles that were essential to his longevity and success, on screen and off. and even when he got knocked down, he had to get back up and fight again.  there are skills that we learned being on a reality show that may help aiken win.  first, his message, which he has already tried and tested during his \"american idol\" days, will get refined in the political arena.  he proudly shared christian beliefs and his passion for young people with special needs, both traits that resonated with viewers    and likely with north carolina voters.  secondly, his relationship with the media during \"idol\" taught him how to deal with them in a smart, shrewd yet upfront and sincere way. the press can spot a fake a mile away.  on \"american idol,\" he quickly learned to forge relationships with the media to connect with those who would cast their votes each week.  in his congressional race, he will likely be able to reach voters in ways that his competitor ca not . because of his tv training, he already knows how to do so.  lastly, his two previous losses    he came in second place behind ruben studdard during the second season of \"idol\" and placed second behind arsenio hall in the fifth season of \"celebrity apprentice\"    could prove to be just the hook in his bid for congress.  going up against an incumbent in a traditionally republican district, voters will see aiken as the underdog and may rally behind him. voters may feel that his time has come.  and everyone roots for the underdog.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of omarosa manigault.   highlight  ex \"apprentice\" star omarosa

tayyip erdogan as mere bluster, assuming that turkey will maintain the status quo in valuing its relationship with the united states on one hand, while resisting irans hegemonic ambitions on the other.  the recent cross border confrontation could ignite regional convulsions as turkey is sucked into syria, leading to belated actions on the part of the international community.  the assad regime knows its time is limited as the rate of military and intelligence officers defecting to jordan and turkey increases in momentum. rebel attacks are inching closer to the heart of the assad regime, such as the recent attack on the syrian air force intelligence compound in the damascus suburb of harasta. this contributes to the regimes recklessness in firing upon turkey with impunity.  ankara may also be emboldened by the fact that iran, a key assad ally, could be limited in its ability to intervene due to its economic woes at home. this week its currency    the rial    plummeted in value due to a combination of sanctions and tehrans own mismanagement of the economy. turkey has less to lose by responding to syrian aggression    this rationale is supported by recent reports that iran has withdrawn from syria   members from a special operations unit attached to its elite quds force.  the conflict in syria is no longer considered a purely internal matter. it clearly has regional ramifications. thus i believe turkeys aim to secure its border is inextricably linked with regime change. its increased military operations may stem from a calculus that it would accelerate the assad regimes demise. the turkish parliaments assent for its troops to conduct operations inside syria is not merely a symbolic attempt to bolster turkish pride while responding to domestic political pressure over the syrian attacks. it gives its armed forces the ability to do more than defend its borders.  it is also likely that nato may assist turkey    a member state    with the defense of its   mile border, creating a de facto humanitarian buffer zone, where the syrian opposition could have a command post. however, this risks escalating the conflict into a nato led mission outside the framework of the united nations . security council    the kind of interventionist measure russia and china would oppose as they did in libya.  the shift towards conflict with syria is characterized by the kind of strategic shift in the region that we have  seen before with turkey. erdogan was initially reluctant to impose sanctions on iran and is now embracing eu sanctions on tehran. the turkish premier was also supportive of irans nuclear ambitions all the while seeking to downgrade relations with tehrans nemesis, israel. now it is aligning itself with the sunni bloc, including gulf states and jordan against iran and its syrian proxy. this could prompt an iranian military response and in turn instigate another spike in oil prices.  the longer the syrian civil war continues, the greater the prospect of regional sectarian tensions emerging along sunni shiite fault lines. this could result in a middle eastern cold war between regional powerhouses saudi arabia, with its mainly sunni population, and the shiite dominated iranians.  meanwhile, the obama administrations apparent strategy of \"leading from behind\" is an excuse for its dithering over the syrian humanitarian crisis. similarly, the united nations\\' inaction over the crisis results from a deadlock at the security council, with china and russia opposed to any intervention    implausibly advocating that the rebels conduct dialogue with a murderous regime.  yet with the american  extensive history of paying lip service to upholding the values of human rights while ignoring genocide in rwanda, sudan, balkans and iraq, its dismissive manner towards the current massacres taking place on a daily basis in syria should come as no surprise. there are estimates that up to  ,  people have been killed, with up to two million people internally displaced since the conflict started. the united nations . claims that  ,  syrians have fled the country.  the american ., realistically the only nation with the necessary military and logistical capability, could easily have prevented the refugee crisis that has heightened the prospect of conflict with turkey. its wariness to arm rebels was to prevent blowback from the syrian muslim brotherhood and other empowered islamists in syria. yet the protracted conflict there has generated a kaleidoscopic civil war and vacuum of governance across much of syria that has attracted islamists, and even revived al qaeda, enabling it to infiltrate the ranks of the opposition and gain support in the wake of its attacks on syrian military and government installations.  the american . and its nato allies could also have prevented much bloodshed by using air power to target the assad regimes military apparatus. syrias military concentrated in damascus, aleppo and northern raqqa province are strained and would be overstretched if forced to respond to external military pressure.  yet washington and its nato allies could now be forced to place a significant number of troops on the ground to prevent the proliferation of syrias stockpile of chemical and biological weapons. the obama administration has resigned itself to wishful thinking assuming, as defense secretary leon panetta has done, that syrian security forces could be held together to secure chemical weapons sites in the wake of the toppling of the assad regime. in a vacuum of governance dominated by islamists, this may become a proliferation nightmare.  while the american . is keen on winding down its involvement in the middle east to refocus its attention on asia, syria may be the instigator that sucks it back into the region for another decade to manage a second cold war.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of barak seener.   highlight  turkeys military

the increasing frequency and scale of mass shootings, have finally forced washington to rethink gun policy.  predictably, emotions are running high on tv talk shows and congressional panels. so it is  a good time to remind ourselves that americans    including gun owners    actually agree about what to do now, and have for a very long time.  from requiring criminal background checks on all gun sales to getting military style assault weapons off our streets, americans understand that it is  entirely possible to respect the rights of law abiding gun owners and do much more to keep people safe. the nation may be politically divided, but on guns there has long been a broad and enduring consensus.  the only people who seem to disagree are the national rifle associations washington lobbyists. what was once a modest gun rights and gun safety organization is long gone. today, as new york city mayor michael bloomberg has said, it is principally a marketing organization, and its flagship product is fear.  opinion  gun extremists\\' alternate reality  this sad development was on full display during wednesdays senate hearing on gun violence, where nra executive vice president wayne lapierre claimed that background checks for gun buyers    a two minute process that most gun buyers are happy to undergo    will become \"a universal federal nightmare imposed upon law abiding people all over the country.\"  as an alternative, lapierre has suggested that the answer to guns is more guns    in the hands of almost anyone, in almost every place in america  every classroom, every daycare center, every movie theater, every shopping mall, every place of worship.  if more guns in more places is the nras proposal, we have  run a pretty good pilot project    and the results are not  good. the american . already has more firearms per capita than any other nation, making it the most heavily armed civilian population in the world. we have a gun murder rate that is about   times higher than other populous, high income countries. this correlation has lost the power to surprise    except perhaps for lapierre, who believes \"the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\"  complete coverage  the gun debate  if only it were that simple. this is not  just about good guys and bad guys. very often, the good guys get shot by bad guys with guns. this is about smart policies and dangerous ones.  gun owners know this, too. those like my dad, a former firearms dealer in colorado, are mainstream americans with mainstream views on guns. thats why    of nra members and    of non nra gun owners believe all gun buyers should get a criminal background check. a cbs/new york times poll released on january   found    of those living in households with gun owners and    in households with nra members support background checks.  they believe we have the right to bear arms, and they believe with rights come responsibilities. an instant background check is not too high a price to pay, when we know the current system    even with big loopholes    has saved many lives.  we have the right to go to the movies without being gunned down in our seats. we have the right to pray in our houses of worship without being victimized by a mentally american table young man and his assault weapon. more than anything, we have the right to send our kids to school in the morning with the guarantee that they will  return home in the afternoon.  opinion  why the nra fights for gun rights  until lawmakers stand up to the gun lobby and stand up for the people they represent, the death toll will only continue to rise      people murdered with guns, every day, everywhere, in the worlds indispensable nation.  when they do, they will  have major police organizations, survivors of gun violence, faith leaders, domestic violence opponents, many millions of parents, and more than   mayors against illegal guns standing with them.  if it is  electoral retribution they are  worried about, they should look at the last election. after investing more millions than ever to defeat president barack obama and elect pro gun politicians, the nra had one of the worst success rates of all political groups  a  .   return on a massive investment of its members\\' hard earned money.  we can pass commonsense gun laws that will save many lives. the american people are demanding it, the president is demanding it, the families of the dead are demanding it.  it is  time for our leaders to buck the nras washington lobbyists. it is  not as hard as they think.

friday in the colorado movie theater shooting reveal that suspect james holmes \"had conversations with a classmate about wanting to kill people\" months before the july   massacre.  the new details about evidence gathered in the case against holmes were made public in a court document filed by prosecutors over a defense move to keep some of the suspects educational records from the university of colorado private.  \"the defendant had conversations with a classmate about wanting to kill people in march  , and that he would do so when his life was over,\" the document says. no other details are provided about those conversations.  holmes,  , is accused of opening fire at an aurora theater last month during a midnight premiere of the latest batman movie, \"the dark knight rises,\" leaving   dead and injuring   others.  he has been charged with murder and attempted murder and faces two weapons charges.  the new document also reveals more details about the timeline of events leading up to the theater shooting, beginning with holmes failing his graduate school oral boards a month before the shooting.  holmes was a ph.d. candidate studying neuroscience at the university of colorados anschutz campus in aurora. soon after, he was \"denied access to the school after june  ,  , after he made threats to a professor.\" prosecutors said thursday that the threats were reported to campus police.  subsequently, holmes \"started the process to voluntarily withdraw from his graduate studies program.\"  \"after he was denied access to the cu denver anschutz campus, he began a detailed and complex plan to obtain firearms, ammunition, a tear gas grenade, body armor, a gas mask and a ballistic helmet, which were used in the commission of the murders and the attempted murders,\" the document says.  a shackled holmes, his hair still dyed red, appeared at a thursday court hearing in the ongoing fight between defense attorneys and prosecutors over access to his educational records.  the main issue is whether the prosecution should receive non medical documents from the university. these would include admissions forms, grades and transcripts. prosecutors argue that holmes\\' records \"are relevant to the investigation.\" the judge did not issue an immediate ruling.  the university of colorado said this month that it hired a former american . attorney to conduct an independent review into how the school handled holmes.  a court document revealed that holmes was a patient of cu psychiatrist lynne fenton before the killings.  she was so concerned about his behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could be a danger to others, cnn affiliate kmgh reported this month, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation.  fentons concerns surfaced in early june, sources told the denver station.  they told kmgh that fenton contacted several members of a \"behavioral evaluation and threat assessment\" team to say holmes could be a danger to others, the station reported.  the \"beta\" team consists of key staff members from various university departments who have specific expertise in dealing with assessing potential threats on campus, the school says on its website.  \"fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the beta team\" in \"the first   days\" of june, but it \"never came together\" because in the period fenton was having conversations with team members, holmes began the process of dropping out of school, a source told kmgh.   highlight  new court documents reveal conversations about wanting to kill   highlight

that the greek people, in a vote to be held as soon as december  , will support his plan to remain in the euro zone despite having to endure the austerity measures that greeces continued membership in the euro club would require.  \"i believe the greek people want us to be a strong partner in the euro zone, a strong partner in europe, and this is at stake,\" papandreou told reporters who had assembled for the g   meeting in cannes, france. \"this is at stake,\" he repeated.  his optimism came in the face of an unveiled threat. if the referendum fails, greece may be kicked out of the euro zone, french president nicolas sarkozy told reporters in a separate news conference in this chic resort town on frances southern coast.  if greece opts not to adhere to a deal reached on october  , then it must leave the euro zone, sarkozy said after meeting for more than two hours with papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel.  but papandreou said the referendum    whose wording he would not discuss    would prove key. \"i want to say that we will have a yes,\" he said.  but first, papandreou faces a confidence vote, slated for friday, that will determine his own political fate. \"this is our first battle,\" he said. asked whether he believed he would win, he said, \"i do hope so but, obviously, this is a democratic process.\"  sarkozy said the ministers of finance of france and germany will meet wednesday. the countries are determined to help greece, but require that greece meet its commitments, he said, adding that the other members of the euro zone would not allow the euro to be destroyed.  greek authorities were informed that europeans and the international monetary fund would disburse a sixth tranche of    billion euros only after the uncertainty is ended and the october   deal is implemented, sarkozy said. greece is now in the last third of its may   bailout, which is worth a total of   billion euros.  in a statement, imf managing director christine lagarde lauded the october   plan, despite its belt tightening requirements.  \"i remain convinced that the agreement reached by the leaders of the euro area at their summit last week, which includes a substantive reduction in greeces debt burden and additional financial support for a new ambitious program, will greatly benefit greece by helping to restore growth and create jobs,\" lagarde said.  she said she welcomed papandreous indication that the referendum would be held as soon as possible. \"as soon as the referendum is completed, and all uncertainty removed, i will make a recommendation to the imf executive board regarding the sixth tranche of our loan to support greeces economic program,\" she said.  asked whether withholding of the tranche would bankrupt greece, papandreou said, \"if everything goes well in the referendum, it is  quite a few days before the sixth tranche is needed to pay up salaries and pensions and so on.\"  papandreou did not attend the news conference at which his french and german counterparts spoke.  the tense times in cannes came on the same day that greeces cabinet voted to support papandreous call for a referendum on the bailout plan.  the vote was unanimous, though some of the ministers expressed criticism prior to casting their votes, cnn affiliate mega channel reported.  german and french markets rallied wednesday after tumbling tuesday on the news of the referendum call, and londons ftse also closed slightly higher. the dow jones industrial average index closed up   points   .   .  papandreou is seeking public backing from the greek people for last weeks bailout deal, an accord that took months to craft.  but the move has created turmoil in domestic politics and angered his european counterparts.  a \"no\" vote could not only force greece to abandon the euro but could send shock waves through the global financial system.  greek foreign minister stavros lambridinis told cnn he was confident the greek people would vote yes. \"everyone is getting a bit tired of doubting the wisdom of the greek people and their commitment to europe,\" he said, adding that greece had proven its dedication in the painful measures it has already taken.  european commission president jose manuel barroso appealed wednesday for national and political unity, saying it would be \"critically important to have stability\" for the bailout deal to be implemented.  \"without the agreement of greece to the eu/imf program, the conditions for greek citizens would become much more painful, in particular for the most vulnerable. the consequences would be impossible to foresee,\" he warned.  last weeks deal would halve the countrys sky high debts, but at a price that has led to angry demonstrations in the streets of greece.  vanessa rossi, an economics adviser to oxford analytica, a global analysis firm, said papandreous referendum call was \"almost inevitable, given that the greek population has continued to protest heavily against the plans agreed  to  in brussels.\"  but she said the greek people are aware that they would suffer greater financial pain if the country defaults.  meanwhile, several senior military leaders in greece have been replaced.  the government council for foreign affairs and defense, which papandreou chairs, decided tuesday on \"sweeping changes in the armed forces\\' leadership,\" the athens news agency reported.  the council replaced the general staff chiefs for the greek army, navy and air force, the news agency said.  though the government said it was a long planned, routine move, its sudden announcement after an extraordinary meeting with the heads of the armed forces makes many dubious, said kostas gemenis, an assistant professor of politics at the university of twente in the netherlands.  politicians have kept a tight rein on the greek armed forces since a seven year military junta was brought to an end in  , gemenis said, but peoples memories are long.  he speculated that the government acted to allay any concern that the military    which seized power in   as the country was anticipating an election    might be planning to repeat history.  \"people want to be on the safe side and try to prevent even worse things happening,\" he said. he added that the news media had not treated it as a major event given the ongoing political and economic crisis.  but the news of the bailout referendum rattled papandreous hold on power tuesday, when a lawmaker defected from his party, leaving him with a majority of only two in parliament.  milena apostolaki said papandreou had made \"an erroneous political decision\" in calling for the referendum. \"it jeopardizes the efforts and the painful sacrifices that are made by the greek people,\" she told cnn on wednesday.  sarkozy and merkel issued a terse statement tuesday saying they were \"determined to ensure the full implementation, without delay, of decisions adopted by the summit, which are necessary now more than ever.\"  in the united states, white house press secretary jay carney struck a similar note, saying papandreous move reinforced the need for europe to \"implement rapidly the decisions they made last week.\"  greeces former deputy finance minister, petros doukas, a member of the opposition new democracy party who is not currently in office, told cnn he doubted the referendum would take place.  papandreou is under enormous pressure from europe, the markets and opposition forces within greece to backtrack on the proposal, doukas said.  he suggested papandreou would have to call

spilling across other borders, threatening the   nations united under the euro currency.  a weekend survey in greece found nearly    opposed the debt deal, but other surveys have shown a more complicated picture.  a survey carried out last week by kappa research for the greek daily newspaper to vima showed a majority of greeks wanted a referendum on the international rescue plan, and that

protests, and what the latest developments might mean for the countrys political future.  who is protesting and why   unlike the   protests, which saw red shirted supporters of ousted prime minister thaksin shinawatra turn out in force, this time around it is opponents of his younger sister yingluck shinawatras government who are protesting in the capital.  as with previous protests, the country is largely divided between a younger, educated urban middle class and a conservative class of poor rural voters, largely from the north of the country. it is the former group who have taken to the streets and are currently battling the police after months of deepening political division.  the protestors, led by suthep thaugsuban    a deputy prime minister in the previous abhisit vejjajiva led government    rejected yinglucks poll in early february and are calling for the creation of an unelected \"peoples council\" headed by a premier appointed by thailands king.  what triggered the current crisis   yinglucks prime ministership was largely stable until her party attempted to pass a controversial amnesty bill in november.  the bill would have nullified former prime minister thaksins corruption conviction and would have allowed him to return to the country. the policeman turned tycoon has been living in exile in a number of different locations, most recently dubai, since he was removed in a bloodless coup in  .  he briefly returned to thailand in  . later that year, he was convicted by a thai court of corruption and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison over a controversial land deal. courts have also frozen billions of dollars of his assets, but he is believed to still have a great deal of money held elsewhere.  what is thaksins role in the current crisis   while he technically plays no part in the current political situation, the deeply divisive thaksin is never far from the heart of thai politics, communicating with supporters via social media and video messages. with his younger sister in power since  , his influence remains strong. critics say yingluck is thaksins proxy but she insists she has always been independent.  the current protests were sparked by attempts by her government to enact the amnesty law that opponents said was designed to protect him and others, facilitating his return to the country    and ultimately, to an active role in thai politics.  why are thai protests in the news so often   the country has had a restive history since the dissolution of its absolute monarchy in  . there have been a dozen military coups d\\'etat over the years, most notably in  , and again in the  s, which led to the creation of a new constitution. the most recent military coup was in  , which led to the ouster of thaksin.  civilian rule was restored with a thaksin linked civilian government in charge but protests in      including the blockade of the capitals airports    eventually led to the creation of a coalition government.     saw pro thaksin supporters, known as the red shirts, take to the streets and demand fresh elections, eventually leading to yinglucks election    which brings us to the current situation.  what impact did the february   election have   under pressure, yingluck dissolved parliament and called for new elections at the beginning of february. these were disrupted by protestors, particularly in the capital and in the south of the country.  ahead of the elections, suthep    the leader of the protests    urged his supporters to boycott the poll and recently petitioned the constitutional court to annul the election. they were not successful and while the results are still in doubt, the country is being ruled by an interim government headed by yingluck, but one that lacks absolute authority.  what role is the thai king playing in all this   despite the turbulent nature of thailands democratic political scene the country is home to the worlds longest serving monarch. bhumibol adulyadej, aged  , is universally revered in thailand but prefers to remain ostensibly neutral in matters of government, although he called for national unity in his birthday speech in december.  what caused the latest flare up   after a period of relative calm    and a feeling that appetite for the protests was dying down    trouble has flared up again this week as police in the capital tried to reclaim official government sites occupied by protestors. reacting to the attempted eviction, around  ,  demonstrators were estimated to be on the streets of the city tuesday.  an outbreak of violence that day saw five people    including at least two protestors and a police office    killed in central bangkok. following police action in which tear gas was fired in an attempt to disperse crowds of demonstrators in the streets, people among the protesters began firing guns at police, who responded with both rubber bullets and live fire.   ,  police are said to have been mobilized in the latest operations. seventy three people    both police officers and opposition supporters    have been wounded in recent clashes.  will the military step in   up until now the military has resisted calls from the protestors to intervene on their behalf, and it seems that its current leadership lacks the appetite for regime change. however, the countrys army chief, general prayuth chan ocha, has not ruled out the possibility that the military will intervene if violence on the streets of bangkok worsens.  what is  the story with the rice pledging scheme   the political crisis took on a new twist when a subsidy program that benefited rice farmers    part of yinglucks base    was decried as corrupt by opposition leaders. the scheme was a centerpiece of yinglucks election platform and has been beset with payment problems.  yingluck criticized her opponents for politicizing the issue, but this week the countrys national anti corruption commission  nacc  announced their decision to charge her with \"dereliction of duty,\" which could have serious implications for her retention of the premiership.  she is expected to answer the charge on february  , according to the bangkok post.  is

president of feehery group, a washington based advocacy firm that has represented clients that include news corp., ford motor co. and the american . chamber of commerce. he formerly was a government relations executive vice president for the motion picture association of america.  john feehery says hes proud obama won the nobel peace prize, but now the president needs to earn it.  washington  cnn     usually, when a president wins the nobel peace prize, it is uniformly seen as a positive development for america and for the world.  both opponents and allies tend to celebrate the fact that an american president actually got recognized by a bunch of norwegians for something he achieved.  but with barack obama, who surprisingly picked up his first nobel prize on friday, the reaction was not altogether positive from either the left or the right.  you would expect that conservatives would raise questions about the presidents award. conservatives raise questions about everything the president does.  but liberals also joined in. mickey kaus of slate said that the president should say thanks, but no thanks. \"turn it down  politely decline. say hes honored but he has not  had the time yet to accomplish what he wants to accomplish.\" liberal columnist richard cohen wrote a mocking column, comparing obamas award to a fictional award given to sarah palin for promising to \"read a book someday.\"  we are all glad that norway loves obama, but come on. lets get serious.  i am reminded of when chicago white sox owner jerry reinsdorf decided to retire the jersey of longtime white sox player harold baines. it was a little premature for baines to get his uniform retired when he himself was playing for another team.  baines played a couple more years, surely the only instance where a players uniform was retired before the player was.   awarding obama the nobel peace prize is similarly premature. in fact, the white house seemed as surprised as anybody about the gesture. i imagine that when obama first picked up the line, he thought it was a crank call.  \"i won what \" he must have exclaimed.  but it is no joke. it seems that president obama won his first nobel peace prize, for, well, being president obama.  just the very idea of a president obama is enough to make the nobel selection committee swoon.  the president said he was humbled by this award. to paraphrase winston churchill, he has much to be humble about.  when it comes to peace, it is hard to see what notable accomplishments have been achieved thus far in the obama presidency. that is not a slap at him. peace takes time.  it took john hume and david trimble about   years of really hard and dangerous work in northern ireland before they got a nobel peace prize. and despite all of that hard work, peace and reconciliation is still elusive in that region.  mr. obama has not  even been able to get a peace deal between nancy pelosi and harry reid, who continue to snipe at each other over the health care public option and afghanistan.  peace has not  exactly broken out in iraq, afghanistan, pakistan, israel, or iran either.  nobel prizes usually go for some fairly notable accomplishments.  nelson mandela spent much of his life protesting apartheid and serving a prison sentence. he is a man who deserved a peace prize.  mikhail gorbachev allowed the soviet union to collapse without much of a whimper. that was an accomplishment that deserved a peace prize.  but what exactly has president obama done to deserve such an award  and if he actually does something in the future, does that mean he gets another one   apparently, the voting on the peace prize started shortly after the president was sworn in. perhaps he is getting the peace prize because of his inaugural address. yep, a lot of people came to that speech, and peace mostly reigned on that day  except for those people with tickets to the inauguration who got stuck in the \"purple tunnel\" in washington . but i do not  think he deserves a peace prize for that.  i guess he got the prize because he was elected president and he was not  george bush. well, if that is the case, maybe all of those millions of americans who voted for him should share the prize, because they actually did most of the work. they voted.  as an american, i am proud that our president was awarded a nobel peace prize.  now, i, like many others on the right and the left, would like to see him do something to earn it.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of john feehery.   highlight  john feehery  obamas nobel

retailers to stop selling two controversial \"illegal alien\" costumes that have surfaced for halloween, saying the outfits are a broadside attack on illegal immigrants.  the \"illegal alien\" costume was being offered by retailers including target, walgreens and amazon.com.  the \"illegal alien adult costume,\" manufactured by forum novelties, includes an orange jumpsuit, similar to prison garb, with \"illegal alien\" stamped in black across the chest; a space alien mask; and a fake green card. the \"illegal alien mask with hat\" also includes a space alien mask, this time with a dark handlebar mustache and a baseball cap.  the coalition for humane immigrant rights of los angeles said it began receiving emails from concerned legal immigrants on friday. in response, chirla wrote a letter asking several retailers, including target, walgreens, and amazon.com, to stop offering the costume.  as of saturday afternoon, target had pulled the products, and some links to the costumes on other sites were no longer functional.  target said the \"illegal alien\" costume was inadvertently uploaded to its web site due to a data entry error.  \"it is never our intent to offend the consumers with the products we offer,\" a company statement said.  the makers of the costumes could not be reached for comment on saturday.  jorge mario cabrera, the director of communications for chirla, said he initially thought the costume was a stab at harmless satire. but when he saw the green card, he realized it was an swipe at illegal immigrants.  \"this was an ignorant attempt to poke fun at a small community,\" said cabrera.  political satire and halloween often merge. costumes depicting former well known political figures are often seen along side those depicting batman or wonder woman.  to some, the attempted humor of the costumes falls flat.  guillermo iglesias said both of his parents were illegal immigrants in the united states. he felt the costumes were offensive because they depicted illegal immigrants as \"not one of us.\"  \"i have a lot of illegal immigrant friends,\" said iglesias. \"if i showed them that costume, it would really hurt them.\"  despite the controversy, some stores say the costumes have been a hit.  \"it is  a very well recommended costume,\" said an employee at rickys, a costume store in new york city. the store has sold seven costumes

children in syria, the first outbreak of the disease in that country since  , a world health organization spokesman told cnn tuesday.  whos oliver rosenbauer said the confirmations were among   suspected cases that were identified on october   in the eastern city of deir ezzor after the children exhibited symptoms of \"acute flaccid paralysis\"    a sudden onset of weakness and floppiness in any part of a childs body or paralysis in anyone in whom polio is suspected as the cause.  the confirmation was key because other diseases can cause similar symptoms.  most of the victims were younger than two years old and were unimmunized or underimmunized, who said in a statement.  the syrian health ministry is working with international organizations and the syrian arab red crescent to get vaccine to all areas of syria, health minister dr. saad al nayef told whos regional committee on monday in muscat, oman, the state run syrian arab news agency reported tuesday.  but dr. bruce aylward, the world health organizations assistant director general for polio, emergencies and country collaboration, told cnn last week that his organization was not waiting for the confirmation to mount a vaccination campaign.  \"as far as everyone is concerned, they are  treating this like polio,\" he said.  on october  , health officials launched a program to immunize  .  million syrian children against polio, measles, mumps and rubella    in government  and rebel held areas. the response, which will also include neighboring countries, is expected to last at least six months, the who said.  according to unicef,  ,  children in syria have not been vaccinated against polio.  given the fighting, the large scale movement of refugees and the number of children who have not been fully immunized, \"the risk of further international spread of wild poliovirus type   across the region is considered to be high,\" it added.  the highly infectious viral disease primarily affects young children. initial symptoms can include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, limb pain and, in a small number of cases, paralysis and death.  it can be prevented through immunization, but there is no cure. the incidence of the disease has dropped by more than    since  . it remains endemic in three countries    pakistan, nigeria and afghanistan    down from more than   countries in  .  public health can be among the first casualties of war, as resources are diverted away from ensuring clean water supplies and intact sewer lines.  despite the challenges posed by the ongoing civil war, the polio vaccination effort will be helped by the fact that syria had high rates of vaccination coverage among its populace prior to the current conflict, aylward predicted.  in an address friday to the united nations . security council, the under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief cited the outbreak as an example of the privations endured by the syrians and the risks they face.  diseases, including those easily preventable by basic hygiene and vaccination, are spreading \"at an alarming rate,\" said valerie amos. in addition, reports of malnutrition have soared, and people suffering from chronic illnesses, such as cancer and diabetes, are dying for lack of access to treatment, she said.  aid workers cannot reach some  .  million people in the country, she added.  \"all humanitarian staff missions and convoys continue to require written approval,\" she said, citing as \"unacceptable\" and \"unpredictable\" the governments processing of visas for united nations . and non governmental staff members. more than   such visas are pending, many are limited to a single entry and many of those that are issued are for insufficient durations, she said.  \"there is simply no reason why humanitarian staff, whose only interest is to help those in desperate need, have not been granted visas to scale up our operations,\" she said.  in response, syrias permanent representative to the united nations acknowledged to reporters in new york that the country is facing grave humanitarian problems, but accused amos of having failed to properly apportion blame.  \"she should know and say what are the root causes,\" bashar jaafari told reporters, citing neighborhoods that are \"under siege by the syrian army because there are armed groups in these neighborhoods taking civilians as human shields.\"  jaafari said his country is \"a victim of interference by some member states into its domestic affairs.\"  regarding the issuance of visas, he said, \"we are issuing too many visas to too many people; we are a sovereign nation, like any other nation; we have our own reasons sometimes to deny a visa to this or that individual.\"  jaafari said damascus has extended visas to hundreds of people working for the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs  ocha , which is led by amos. \"any minimal cases here and there\" of problems \"would not  affect the overall picture of our cooperation with ocha,\" he said.  according to the united nations, more than  ,  people have died in the conflict, which began in march   when

populous country, to become the no.   market for the company.  equally heavyweight tech companies google or facebook can only watch with envy. it is not because of lack of effort that they are nowhere near the success of apple in china. their businesses are just too different.  the chinese governments tight control on freedom of information flow applies especially to the internet. web access is filtered on a regular basis. social media websites such as facebook and twitter are blocked because the government deems them as potential hot spots for facilitating politically sensitive or socially inappropriate content.  meanwhile, google is operational in china but has to route all searches to its hong kong site, and the access is often interrupted. so, it is fair to say that the chinese government is the reason why companies such as google and facebook are not doing well in china.  in contrast, apple mainly sells hardware, so it has not run into any censorship problems.  chinese consumers love electronic gadgets. mobile phones are ubiquitous. apple is doing incredibly well because its products are so much more attractive and pricy. the iphone quickly become a status symbol product in chinese social circles since its debut. likewise, the ipad also joined the must have list as soon as it was launched.  if someone wants to lubricate his \"guanxi\"    relationship    with an important person, these two products are often the gift of choice. before the ipad reached china, a businessman in shanghai told me that in the back of his car trunk, he had stocked at least   ipads, all bought in hong kong. \"it is the most loved present for government officials,\" he claimed.  the social pressure of having an apple product is strong, especially as the wealthy elites set the trend. if a middle class chinese consumer cannot afford an expensive car or watch, sporting an iphone may be just as good. even the bad press surrounding foxconn, the main manufacturer of apple products, did not make too much of a dent on the companys sales.  there is no doubt that china will be an important market for apple in the coming years. among the three main telecommunications companies in the country, china mobile is the only one without apples iphone support despite the fact that it is the largest operator with nearly   million subscribers. many high end china mobile customers still stay in  g network because china mobiles  g network does not have iphones. if china mobile gets its own version of iphone, as rumor has it recently, then it would be a shot in the arm for apple.  interestingly enough, apples growth in china is all from its hardware.  its itunes store sales from music, videos, books or apps downloads are almost negligible. this has nothing to do with the government. there is no censorship of itunes other than apples own self screening mechanism.  poor sales from itunes store owe more to the fact that the chinese are habitually reluctant to pay for intellectual properties. to make things worse, there are so many websites that offer \"jailbreak\" tips so that people can easily bypass apple and get free downloads elsewhere.  there are rumors that apple might consider adding a cheaper version of the iphone for the chinese market. in light of the fast growing smartphone market, cheaper phones seem to make sense especially since there are still millions of chinese who cannot afford a pricy iphone of   yuan  roughly    dollars .  but apple should stay away from the idea.  it does not make sense to sacrifice profit margin just for a greater market share. doing so would tarnish the premium image of apple and erode the love and loyalty of the elites. one lesson that apple can learn is that not long ago, nokia used to own the chinese market but it became so popular that it lost its appeal to the elites. nokia ended up trying a new brand, vertu, to entice consumers, but it was not very successful.  by building more retail stores in china, apple would certainly accelerate its growth. but the challenge is to maintain its prestige so that consumers would not lose interest and crave for a new elite brand.  apple might also want to rethink its itunes store business model in china so that it can generate sales in other ways. hardware comes and goes. one day, apple products can and will be replaced. but demand for books, movies, music, and apps is ongoing.  will apple find a way to tap into the chinese consumption for content  we will  just have to see.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of

made his directorial debut with a low budget, high octane car crash comedy called \"grand theft auto.\"  as first impressions go, it did not signal the second coming of orson welles. but the freckle faced former \"happy days\" star radiated an infectious delight in smashing as many roaring muscle cars as he could get away with.  since then, of course, howard has become one of hollywoods most consistent and respected filmmakers, crafting well made crowd pleasers that tackle more highbrow subjects. but judging from his white knuckle new film, \"rush,\" he has not  outgrown his youthful sweet tooth for four wheeled mayhem. he still has hot rods and the death defying men who drive them on his mind.  based on the real life rivalry between formula one racing legends james hunt and niki lauda, \"rush\" is a tale of two opposite personalities eyeing the same checkered flag goal  winning the   world championship. chris hemsworth draws the flashier role in hunt, a fast burning british bad boy with flowing blond locks, silk shirts unbuttoned to his navel, and a rakish playboy swagger.  on and off the track, hes wild, cocky, and undisciplined â\\x80\\x94 a deadly combination when you are  strapped into a coffin on wheels going   miles an hour. \\'\\'the closer you are to death, the more alive you feel,\\'\\' hemsworths hunt says. and it is  thanks to the \"thor\" stars champagne spraying charisma that he makes risking your neck look like the coolest job on the planet.  as lauda, \"inglourious basterds\\'\" daniel brã¼hl buries his boyish good looks behind ratlike prosthetic teeth. with his clipped austrian accent, everything that comes out of his mouth sounds like a brusque insult. and it usually is. he may not be a particularly likable fellow, but hes a methodical grinder with the american hakable conviction of someone whos calculated the odds on what it takes to win. pitted against each other, they are  like wile e. coyote and the road runner. it is  not just about beating the other guy, it is  about humiliating him in the process.  ew  \\'rush\\'  olivia wilde, chris hemsworth in high octane scene  howards film is at its best when the rubber meets the road. \"rush\" traces the thrilling, neck and neck   season from start to finish, hopscotching from brazil to monaco to japan. even though the film hurtles from one exotic locale to the next, the speedway sequences never feel repetitive â\\x80\\x94 and they never let up on the gas.  more than in any racing movie since  s \"grand prix,\" the action scenes capture the daredevil kick of sitting in the cramped, claustrophobic cockpit of a ferrari, zipping around hairpin turns as tires squeal and engines roar.  things are not  quite as thrilling off the track. when they are  not putting the pedal to the metal, lauda and hunt are painted as broad archetypes â\\x80\\x94 the bad and the beautiful. it does not  help that both men are given a perfunctory love interest  olivia wilde for hemsworth and alexandra maria lara for brã¼hl , neither of whom feels fleshed out or is given much to do other than look worried. they are  as much spectators as the fans in the stands.  it is  only in the last third of the film that hunt and lauda become flesh and blood human beings instead of videogame avatars. jockeying with each other to become the leader in the standings, the two men arrive at germanys nã¼rburgring track, where drizzly conditions prove why the harrowing course is called the graveyard.  lauda, ahead in points, argues that it is  too dangerous to race and that the event should be canceled, while hunt uses his back slapping charm to get the other drivers to vote lauda down. naturally, disaster follows as lauda, barely able to see through his rain soaked visor, crashes in a grisly fireball, horrifically burning his face and lungs. as he struggles to recover in the hospital, hunt closes in on first place, which in turn fuels his enemy to rehabilitate faster and return to battle.  the thought of a man covered in monstrous third degree scars wincing in agony as he pulls his racing helmet over his head so that he can get back behind the wheel may sound insane. but as both howard and millions of racing fans around the world know, it is  also compelling human drama.  \"rush\" hits a few potholes, but in the end it reveals the psyches of two men who only feel alive when they are  cheating death. grade  b  see the original story at ew.com.  click here to try   risk free issues of entertainment weekly  â©   entertainment weekly and time inc. all rights

up in brooklyn, new york.  coming to america from ethiopia, a place where black and white were only colors that had little to do with race, i had to learn english, and also the language of identity.  in america, i was black.  so when some online commenters questioned whether boston marathon winner and eritrean american meb keflezighi is truly \"american,\" it reminded me of my own experience as an immigrant who became a naturalized american citizen and embraced a new identity.  my parents, two brothers and i had an incredible life in ethiopia.  we always had the newest toys and clothes from my fathers frequent work related trips abroad.  there were lots of friends and just as much family. life was very communal, much like our style of eating.  of course, ethiopia was not perfect, but it was all that i knew.  my well traveled parents wanted to grant my brothers and i the opportunities that america offered.  movies shaped my brothers\\' and my perception of america. as far as i was concerned, everyone lived in massive homes, owned multiple cars and was generally happier.  the movie \"coming to america\" stunned me the most. the images of homeless people and the rundown apartment occupied by the characters played by eddie murphy and arsenio hall contradicted the america of my imagination.  in the weeks before leaving ethiopia, my older brother yoseph and i used to stay up late talking about how a group of welcoming american friends, a brand new american car and a huge american house would soon be ours.  but landing in oklahoma city, our expectations soon dissipated.  from the thick, humid air that permeates oklahoma in august to the instant feeling of being an outsider, we began to breathe less easy.  in my fourth grade class, my peers were not as curious about me as i was about them. they avoided me and teased me for being african.  i mostly attributed my peers\\' distaste for me to my country of origin, until the day my older brother yoseph came home from school after getting into a fight with a boy.  the boy had called him a \"nigger.\"  i soon realized it was not  just because of our funny accents or nationality that people treated us differently.  in america, we were seen as \"black.\" i became painfully aware of my brown skin, my unruly hair, and the disapproving looks directed my way.  and so my introduction to american culture began.  by the time my family moved to colorado, the outsized expectations of america were a distant memory.  i felt i had a better grasp of american culture and my new black identity. my english was fluent, without a trace of an accent; it allowed me to socialize with less reluctance.  i quickly made friends at my junior high school and became involved in extracurricular activities. i found comfort in having friends that looked like me.  by the time i was a teenager, working weekends serving meals at a retirement home, i learned the difference between subtle and overt racism.  there was a man there who refused to speak to me, let me take his order, or even look me in the eyes because i was black. it was understood that only my white co workers would interact with him.  the people i was close to would praise me by saying how well my parents raised me, and told me  \"you are  not like the rest of them. you are  different.\"  i almost thought that they said these things as a compliment.  but i understood they were making an exception for me, in order to maintain their bigoted views of black and brown people. because i defied the scope of their prejudice, i had to be unique.  this infuriated me.  i tried to take off the cuff comments from the elderly with a grain of salt. after all, they are from a different time period, when those sentiments were expected and accepted.  but it was when i heard my peers say, \"you are  not really black. you do not  even act black,\" that i realized just how much the perceived singularity of the black identity transcends generations, age and gender.  this made me embrace my \"blackness\" more passionately, and i began to identify more as \"black\" than ethiopian.  i was not  quite ethiopian enough for some of my ethiopian friends who were convinced moving to the american . at such a young age caused me to lose some legitimacy. my vivid memories of ethiopia and ability to speak my native language did not  cement my \"ethiopian ness\" to some.  and i did not live up to my american peers\\' expectations of being african american either, even after becoming a naturalized citizen.  so there i was, the president of the ethiopian students association, a member of the black student alliance, and the founder of united women of color at colorado state university.  i became quite the skilled juggler. but it was exhausting.  tired of the balancing act, i began to care less and less about others\\' perceptions of me.  eventually, i became proud of not fitting neatly into someone elses definition of being black or ethiopian.  when i moved to new york, i felt at home, and met people with a similar understanding of black identity    one that was varied and nuanced. they were more interested in having conversations about my experiences, and less interested in my color.  i no longer felt the weight of defending all of the different aspects of my identity to everyone.  but there is one thing about the black identity that remains constant  the complexities of the individual experiences that inform our identity.  yes, i am black. i am ethiopian. i am american.  i am also a journalist, a filmmaker, a sister, a daughter, a friend, an avid traveler and a woman who is constantly growing and evolving.  there is no doubt that my experiences, at times turbulent, have contributed to my racial identity. but my identity is never static. instead, it remains fluid.  the reality is that my story is not singular simply because i was born abroad. it is distinctive in the way that each of us, as individuals, is distinct.  and so are our identities.  so when people say i am not \"really black\" or that meb keflezighi is not \"really american,\" i would  invite them to run a mile in each of our shoes    to see what we have  gone through to become as uniquely american as anyone.   highlight  some have said boston marathon winner meb keflezighi is not truly american   highlight  haimy assefa writes that she faced similar

include details of a distant, long deceased relative who had owned slaves  seriously, who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline  i would not , and neither did ben affleck, who lobbied producers of a pbs show, \"finding your roots,\" to remove any reference to his great great great grandfather benjamin cole, a georgia slave owner in the mid  s, in an episode that looked at afflecks family history.  affleck revealed coles name wednesday night.   heres the thing that might surprise many, given the tendency of the media to exploit any potentially scandalous material  the shows producer, harvard professor henry louis gates jr., apparently acquiesced to afflecks request, because when the episode aired in october  , there was no mention of the stars slave owning ancestor.  afflecks attempt to alter the content of the program only publicly became known a few days ago after wikileaks released hacked emails revealing an exchange between gates and sony pictures chief michael lynton. when gates asked how he should respond to afflecks request to delete the material, lynton responded, \"all things being equal, i would definitely take it out.\"  and on tuesday, affleck, via facebook, admitted that he had urged gates to excise any reference to his slave owning relative. affleck explained, \"i did not  want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. i was embarrassed. the very thought left a bad taste in my mouth.\"  now gates has publicly denied that he made his decision about the content of the program based on afflecks request, but it seems likely that he did. after all, affleck noted as much in his facebook post, writing that gates \"agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices i disagreed with.\"  and three other celebrities profiled on the series last season were shown to have been related to slave owners. so it is  unlikely that it was simply happenstance that it left out any reference to afflecks familial slave ownership connection. in any event, pbs has launched an internal review to determine if the show violated its own editorial standards.  whatever the results of the review, affleck and gates did the right thing. lets be clear  \"finding your roots\" is not an investigative news show; it is  an entertainment program. in fact, as affleck noted, much of the material is provided directly by the celebrity being profiled. it is  not \"  minutes\" but more in the nature of a sophisticated profile of celebrities, using their marquee names to attract viewers.  theres not even a hint that affleck strong armed the producers or made any type of threats against them if they included the information. in the emails between gates and lynton, which they presumably believed at the time were confidential and would remain so, there was no mention of undue pressure by affleck. instead, gates simply noted that affleck  \"asked us to edit out something.\"  after the emails were revealed, gates issued a statement, saying, \"ultimately, i maintain editorial control on all of my projects and, with my producers, decide what will make for the most compelling program. in the case of mr. affleck we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry    including a revolutionary war ancestor, a third great grandfather who was an occult enthusiast, and his mother who marched for civil rights during the freedom summer of  .\"  my view would be different if affleck had a history of uttering racist remarks or engaging in racist conduct. that would have made the information truly newsworthy. but instead we have a man known for championing progressive causes, which i am  sure made him even more acutely sensitive that some on the right might possibly use this information against him in the future. perhaps thats what affleck meant in his facebook post when he wrote that this information made him feel \"vulnerable.\"  affleck has noted that he regrets asking pbs to not include information about his \"distant relative.\"  thats a nice gesture, but it was not needed. affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long deceased distant relative to be left out of the show. and pbs had the choice to include it or leave it out. i applaud pbs for doing the right thing at a time when media outlets rarely show any restraint on the lives of people in the public eye.   highlight  ben affleck admits he asked pbs show \"finding your roots\" to avoid mentioning his

excuse never to get married.\\'\"  not so. as soon as the judges ruling was reported, \"we ran down here,\" dabakis said as he surveyed the crowd. \"it is  a madhouse down here. theres hundreds of people, wedding certificates are being issued, theres marriages taking place all over the hallways. everybodys embracing. it is  just a warm, wonderful moment in the state of utah.\"  in striking down the state law, which voters had approved in  , american . district court judge robert j. shelby wrote in a   page ruling that the states \"current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same sex couples for no rational reason.  \"accordingly, the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional,\" he said.  shelby said lawyers for the state had offered no evidence that opposite sex marriage would be affected and that their \"fears and speculations are insufficient to justify the states refusal to dignify the family relationships of its gay and lesbian citizens.\"  in addition, the constitution protects the rights of same sex couples, including their right to marry and to have that marriage recognized by their government, he said. \"these rights would be meaningless if the constitution did not also prevent the government from interfering with the intensely personal choices an individual makes when that person decides to make a solemn commitment to another human being. the constitution therefore protects the choice of ones partner for all citizens, regardless of their sexual identity.\"  the lawsuit was brought by one gay and two lesbian couples in utah who wish to marry but have been unable to do so because the utah constitution prohibits same sex marriage.  the decision was greeted with joy from a spokesman for glaad, formerly the gay   lesbian alliance against defamation. \"at last, loving and committed couples in utah will have the opportunity to celebrate marriage equality this holiday season,\" said wilson cruz in a posting on its website.  \"we are seeing state leaders and more and more citizens recognize that loving and committed couples should not be legally kept apart,\" said cruz. \"we look forward to seeing that momentum to continue in  .\"  gov. gary r. herbert expressed disappointment at the ruling by shelby, whom he called \"an activist federal judge.\" herbert said he was working with his legal counsel and the acting attorney general \"to determine the best course to defend traditional marriage within the borders of utah.\"  a spokesman for the church of jesus christ of latter day saints said in a statement that it supports \"traditional marriage,\" while teaching that everyone should be treated with respect. \"this ruling by a district court will work its way through the judicial process,\" eric hawkins said.  \"we continue to believe that voters in utah did the right thing by providing clear direction in the state constitution that marriage should be between a man and a woman and we are hopeful that this view will be validated by a higher court.\"  the president of the national organization for marriage, brian brown, called the ruling \"a travesty of justice.\"  in a statement, he added, \"this trend of vetoing the voters from the bench must be stopped.\"  that view was not shared by clifford rosky, chairman of the board of equality utah. \"we think it is a thoughtful and careful ruling that is based on the supreme court decision last summer and we expect that it will be upheld ultimately by the united states supreme court,\" he said.  by early friday evening, rosky told cnn he had signed as a witness to multiple marriages among same sex couples.  though the state has already filed a notice of appeal, the states lawyers did not file a motion for a stay  in district court, which allowed the marriages to begin at once. \"why they did not  ask the district court for a stay is a mystery, to say the least,\" rosky said.  \"there are hundreds of people here    it is  past   o\\'clock and the clerk is not closing the door.\"  same sex marriage is banned by constitutional amendment or state law in  alabama,

worldwide,   other countries  and parts of mexico  have laws allowing same sex marriage and domestic partnerships. most of these are in europe and south america.  civil unions, which are legal in colorado, grant couples most of the rights of state civil marriages, but provide none of the federal benefits of marriage, such as social security benefits.  these rights include spousal support, medical decision making privileges, access to a partners insurance, and hospital visitation rights.  though the american . supreme court has signaled that it is reluctant to issue a national opinion on the matter, lower courts and states have not been so reluctant, said carl tobias, a professor of constitutional law at the university of richmond.  \"i am  just struck by how quickly this is all moving,\" he said. \"it just seems like it is  picking up steam in terms of challenges.\"  he attributed the change to a greater acceptance of gays and lesbians, especially among young people. \"they just do not  see this as a great moral issue that needs to be something codified as a prohibition in the law,\" he said. \"everybody knows gay people    either in their families or friends or workplaces    so what is  the big deal \"  president bill clinton signed the defense of marriage act banning federal recognition of same sex marriage and defining marriage as \"a legal union between

detailing her sons partying ways and the infamous bong photo.  the following is an edited version of the transcript.  larry king  you have this terrific new book coming. if i do say so myself, it is  inspiring. yet  thursdays  lead story in the \"new york daily news\" gate crasher column    i do not  know who writes that    \"tsk, tsk,\" it says, \"michael phelps, partying your face off in public is not the way to reclaim your good guy image. the olympian was been laying relatively low since his bong smoking scandal in january was out in full force tuesday night at new york city hot spot marquis\"    i think is the name    \"michael was definitely having a good time, an eyewitness tells us, drinking straight from a bottle of grey goose. when the dj started playing mias \\'paper planes,\\' he got up started dancing like a loon and kept on yelling shots.\\' phelps definitely had enough alcohol on hand for several four round. he ordered four bottles of vodka.\"  is this tough for a mother  how do you react   debbie phelps  it is  one thing that i learn at a very early age is i do not  get caught up in gossip columns. i know my son. he has great values, lots of integrity. thats what i think about that.  king  did you talk to him about this   phelps  i always talk to michael. i talk to michael every day. we talked about training today and things of that nature.  king  but it would be normal to say, what happened, would not  it  i would say that to my son.  phelps  we give support. we give guidance. we give an ear to listen. and, again, i do not  get caught up in gossip.  king  therefore, you do not  believe it  i just want to establish what your feelings are.  phelps  i do not  get caught up in gossip, mr. king.  king  what about something that was not  gossip, the picture with the bong thing. it was a picture.  phelps  it is  a picture, thats true. but, you know, a picture can say many things. it has many words. it has many meanings. it has many visualizations that you want to think. it depends on the person who is looking at that picture.  you know, as a mom, i support all three of my children. i believe that no matter who you are in this country, in this world, there are obstacles that get into your life. i call them speed bumps in school sometimes. i heard someone say lightning bolts. thats another term for that.  but, you know, how do we grow  how do we learn  you raise a child through  . you send them off to college. you give them the roots. you give them the foundation to be a strong, young man, a strong lady. life throws curve balls to you sometimes. how do you handle that curve ball   king  michael is  . thats an adult. hes an adult.  phelps  a young adult.  king  young adult. so one could say it is  his life. he chooses to lead it. as our parent, we do our best to guide them, but   is  . do you view him still as a kid   phelps  i view my   year old daughter as a kid sometimes. you know, i look at each of my children independently and individually of themselves. they have many strong values, strong points, professionalism. i am  just very proud of all three of them and everything they have  done.  king  do you think these kind of stories    and you do not  pay attention to them    hurt your book   phelps  i was asked many times and told many times, \"debbie, you need to write a book some day.\" as an educator, i am  thinking, i would really like to do that. it became a personal goal of mine to be able to publish a book, not knowing exactly what it was going to be.  was it going to be my life  was it going to be parenting  was it going to be swimming  was it just going to be motivational and inspirational  when i take a look at the book i was able to write, i have great pride in that book because it shows other people, every woman, but not even women    men can read this book also    the inspiration and motivation of life.  king  the question is, \"do you think these kind of stories might hurt the chance of people buying the book, which is what you want \"  phelps  people are going to have to make that decision.  king  do you think it might   phelps  life is life. i do want to say, though, in reference to the beijing olympics, we, as a family, i think, made a great impression on the world, on the united states. my son has great love for me. it is  a great bonding relationship. families are very important.  king  is he still a role model, do you think   phelps  you know, when i think of the word role model, i will  go back to me being a little girl. it was my mom and my dad. they were my role models when i was growing up. when i hear that role model in a sentence with my son, what i think about with michael is what he does with and for children. it might be things people do not  even know of    his association with the boys and girls club. for years, he has done that  and  his association with make a wish.  he touches kids\\' lives. so if an individual, wherever they may be, may select my son as a role model, i say that my son has strong values. i say hes a human being. and i say that from obstacles that get in peoples ways    we all have them, mr. king, and you know that    what do you learn from them and how do you rise above the occasion    highlight  debbie phelps says she does not  get caught up in gossip involving son, michael

himself to his hostages in a deadly standoff at a kosher market in eastern paris    and perhaps unbeknownst to him, a radio station was listening, a recording purportedly reveals.  french radio station rtl says that it called the market friday after authorities say coulibaly took customers and workers hostage. coulibaly apparently took the call and then tried to hang up, the station says, but the line remained open.  in a recording of what followed, a man the station identifies as coulibaly holds a dialogue with others    apparently hostages    in which he says he attacked because the french military has attacked muslims in the middle east and mali, including isis militants.  \"i was born in france. if they did not  attack other countries, i would not  be here,\" a voice says in rtls recording.  officials say coulibaly killed four hostages in the grocery store, and he was then shot and killed when police raided the store to free the hostages.  one freed hostage, who gave her name only as marie, told cnn affiliate bfmtv that the gunman started shooting \"as soon as he got inside.\"  \"we were sitting, and at our right there were two corpses    two customers who died at the very beginning,\" marie said.  \"... he scared us because he told us, \\'i am  not afraid to die.\\' and he said, \\'either i die or i go to jail for   years.\\' \"  store worker lassana bathily told bfmtv that he guided a group of shoppers into a downstairs walk in freezer.  coulibaly demanded the people come american tairs or he would shoot them, bathily said.  the worker said he shut off the light in the room and the power to the freezer and told the people to stay calm.  \"i am  the one is going to go out,\" he recounted telling them. \"i took the elevator and went american tairs.\"  when the doors of the freight elevator opened, he looked both ways. he saw no one, so he ran.  once outside, he was detained by police, but later helped them by describing the supermarket floor plan. it was unclear whether the people were able to remain downstairs.  israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said he would  spoken by phone with a survivor who told him that a young, male jew was shot after he tried to grab the gunmans weapon.  \"he was shot, and struggling for his life for   minutes,\" netanyahu said, recounting what the survivor told him.  the four slain victims were identified saturday by the french jewish publication jssnews as being yohan cohen,  , yoav hattab,  , philippe braham and francois michel saada.  the four hostages were killed by the gunman before police stormed the market, paris prosecutor francois molins said friday.  recording  \\'militants are going to come\\'  coulibaly was part of the same islamic jihadist groups as cherif and said kouachi, the brothers who police say committed wednesdays massacre at the charlie hebdo magazine offices in paris and were killed in a separate standoff north of paris on saturday, french police union spokesman pascal disant said.  in rtls recording, the man purported to be coulibaly tells the hostages that they are accountable for frances actions against muslim militants abroad, in part because the hostages pay taxes and elect the governments leaders.  \"but i am telling you, it is  almost over. militants are going to come. there are going to be more and more. they  france  need to stop. they need to stop attacking isis,\" the man says, referring to the islamic state in iraq and syria, the sunni muslim extremist group and al qaeda offshoot that is waging a brutal war for what it says is its islamic caliphate in the middle east.  \"they need to stop asking our women to remove the hijab,\" the man continues. a french law banning the burqa, a full body covering that includes a mesh over the face, and the niqab, a full face veil with an opening for the eyes, went into effect in april  .  argument with hostages about taxes  the man purported to be coulibaly,  , apparently argued with hostages about taxes, rtls recording shows.  \"you pay taxes, so that means you agree\" with frances actions in mali and the middle east, the apparent gunman says in the recording.  \"but we have to pay,\" another voice says.  the response from the apparent gunman appeared incredulous  \"what  we do not  have to. i do not  pay my taxes \"  \"when i pay my taxes, it is  for the highways, schools,\" an apparent hostage says. \"we pay our taxes but we do not  harm anybody,\" a person also says.  the man purported to be coulibaly says  \"everyone could get together. if they could get together for charlie hebdo ... they could do the same thing for us and get together for us.\"  cnn could not independently verify that the speaker was coulibaly.  separately, alexi delahousee, a journalist with cnn affiliate bfmtv, spoke to coulibaly on the phone during the hostage situation, bfmtv reported.  coulibaly said that he belonged to isis and had synchronized his attacks with the kouachi brothers. paris police say that coulibaly is suspected in thursdays fatal shooting of a police officer in the montrouge suburb, a day after the charlie hebdo massacre of   people and a day before the friday market raid.  israeli government sources told cnn that french president franã§ois hollande had told netanyahu that   hostages were rescued.  police are searching for coulibalys romantic partner, hayat boumeddiene,  . disant initially said she was a suspect in the market raid and may have escaped, and police also named her as a suspect in thursdays shooting of the police officer in montrouge.  but it was not  clear if she was in france. she entered turkey on january  , a turkish prime ministry source told cnn on saturday. if that is accurate, it could mean boumeddiene was not in france at the

put up with bad governance on the continent.  ibrahim says the face of africa has changed and the arab spring has shown the world that the younger generation are not afraid to demand change.  \"theres a lot of african people who are educated and well informed and thats a better generation than ours and those people wont take nonsense,\" he said.  \"these are the people that went out in tahrir square, tunis and libya and bred havoc,\" he added.  the businessmans remarks come as his foundation awards its annual prize for good governance and leadership in africa.  it has been two years since the mo ibrahim foundation has awarded the accolade, which goes to candidates based on their \"exercise of leadership and the performance of their country during their time in office,\" according to the mo ibrahim foundation website.  the committee, made up of former leaders and nobel prize winners, said that there had been no worthy candidates in the previous two years.  \"they have a strict criteria, this is not a pension, this is a prize for excellence in leadership, it is  not easy,\" said ibrahim.  former cape verde president, pedro verona pires, who stepped down in august after   years in power, was recognized this year.  the group said that the leader had turned the cluster of islands off the west african coast into \"a model of democracy, stability and increased prosperity.\"  the chair of the prize committee, salim ahmed salim, said. \"under his   years as president, the nation became only the second african country to graduate from the united nations least developed category and has won international recognition for its record on human rights and good governance.\"  the ibrahim prize for achievement in african leadership is one of the worlds most valuable individual prizes. ibrahim made a fortune in the cell phone industry, established the foundation bearing his name in  .  previous winners include mozambiques former president, joaquim chissano and botswanas president, festus mogae.  the    million award is paid over   years and   ,  annually for life thereafter. the foundation will also consider funding good causes supported by the laureate.  ibrahim says the prize is needed as leaders in african countries can sometimes be tempted to hang on to power for monetary reasons.  he says he had to start the foundation because leaders were not doing the job they were supposed to do.  president teodoro obiang nguema mbasogo of equatorial guinea and angolas president jose eduardo dos santos are two of the longest running leaders in africa. both have been head of their respective countries for   years. while zimbabwes president robert mugabe has been in power for   years since  .  the foundation uses an   criteria index to grade governance in africa. the top governed african nations, according to the index, are mauritius, cape verde, seychelles, botswana and south africa.  but while there may not have been an award in the previous two years, ibrahim predicts the foundation will be giving out more money in the future.  \"i think the quality of leaders coming to africa now are really improving a lot and what is important in africa is the rise in civil society,\" he said.  \"the pressure from civil society, i am  sure is going to bring forward and produce more and more wonderful leaders for our future,\" he continued.  the hope of the foundation is to help the continent move towards greater democracy and peaceful transitions of power.  however, ibrahim believes that the game is up for leaders who cling to power for   to   years. his cites libyas former leader for   years, moammar gaddafi, as an example.  \"the message is clear to all this kind of generation of leadership  gentlemen time is up,\" he said.

century flanders and a mysterious mill perched atop a hollow cliff, pieter bruegel the elders   painting \"the way to calvary\" is a complex, multi layered work laden with symbolism and drama.  looking at it, according to polish director lech majewski, is rather like watching a movie unfold    which is why he has brought the painting to life in his new feature film \"the mill and the cross.\"  \"i started as a painter and as a poet and i went to make movies strictly because i believed that the painters i was fascinated would be making movies if they were still alive,\" he told cnn.  based on a book about the painting called \"the mill and the cross,\" majewskis film shows bruegel  played by rutger hauer  discussing the development of his work with patron nicolaes jonghelinck  played by michael york .  faithfully recreated vignettes play out alongside scenes portraying the artists creative process, while others depict a mysterious miller figure, representing god, presiding over a mill improbably located on top of a sheer, hollow cliff.  \"the mill and the cross\" premiered in london in march, and has received favorable reviews, notably from \"the new york times,\" whose critic daniel m. gold called the film an \"inspiring, alluring meditation about imagery and storytelling.\"  majewksi is drawn to bringing art to life  he wrote the screenplay for   film \"basquiat,\" about the life of new york artist jean michel basquiat, and directed   film \"the garden of earthly delights,\" which follows an art historian entering into hieronymus boschs famous triptych.  \"for me, bruegel is time,\" said the director. \"you cannot just come and look once at one of his paintings, you always have to enter the work.  \"he has this magnetic pull and once you are  in, you become entangled in what the figures are doing and you make up your own stories. you can spend your whole life with it, easily outside of the length of a movie,\" he said.  transporting the painting into such a different medium, however, took patience  the result is a mix of old fashioned craftsmanship and the latest in digital film making technology.  costumes were hand sewn by polish seamstresses and dyed with tints made from boiled onions, beetroots and apples, as they would have been in bruegels day; the \"right\" color black was achieved by burning a candle against a pane of glass, rather than relying on computers to recreate the exact hue; and majewski himself had to take up bruegels brush and complete a partially visible tree in the top left corner of the painting to extend the field of vision for the camera to pan across.  but some of the more complex scenes, such as the motions of the mill on the rock, required the use of  d and cgi.  \"many times i felt that we were doing a digital tapestry, thread by thread,\" said majewski.  \"we were extremely lucky in that we were riding the crest of wave in technological advancements because literally every week the guys in the computer department were discovering new plug ins and new developments in the field and employing it for what i wanted to achieve,\" he said.  the film, he explained, was composed of layers, because the flanders of the painting is a surreal figment of the artists imagination, comprising seven different perspectives.  obtaining the \"key\" to this aesthetic was hard work, said majewski, because \"bruegel is a magician in creating these illusory kinds of funnels in the painting.\"  he added  \"his landscapes are like funnels that your eye is dipped into and goes to naturally; he knows how to keep your eye employed and moving.\"  an exhibition of lech majewskis work, including his film installation \"bruegel suite,\" based on \"the mill and the cross\" is currently on view at the wapping project in london. \"the mill and the cross\" opens in cinemas in italy on march  , in argentina in april, and in spain in june. the painting which inspired the film,

the worlds time zones, notes croft, are \"currently based on political borders and outdated views of travel, commerce and communications. divisions that are often illogical.\"  to address the point, the architect designed an alternative artistic model of a single, shared   hour cycle worldwide, which \"challenges us to relax our preconceived notions of structures that are contrived and artificial.\"  one universe. one world. one time.  in crofts model, time would be re calibrated biannually on the equinoxes  fall and spring .  leap year adjustments would be replaced by a brief semi

commissioner came down hard tuesday on los angeles clippers owner donald sterling, ordering him out of his teams business and pushing to force him to sell over racist remarks that caused a firestorm since becoming public days ago.  adam silver detailed sterlings punishment of a lifetime ban and   .  million fine    the \"maximum amount\" allowed per league guidelines    at a press conference eight hours before sterlings clippers were to tip off in the fifth game of a tightly contested first round playoff series with the golden state warriors.  silvers decision was met with immediate support from nba owners, players and others connected to the league who have been calling for swift, firm punishment ever since tmz posted audio featuring the incendiary comments.  \"i hope that every bigot in this country sees what happened to mr. sterling and recognizes that if he can fall, so can you,\" sacramento mayor kevin johnson, a former nba all star who was tasked with leading the nba players unions efforts on this matter.  sterling scandal  silvers moment to shine  under the lifetime ban, sterling is prohibited from attending nba games or practices, stepping foot inside any clippers\\' facility, taking part in business or personnel decisions, or having a role in league activities such as attending nba board of governors meetings.  silver    who succeeded longtime nba leader david stern in february    also insisted he will do \"everything in my power\" to compel the nba board of governors to \"force a sale\" of the clippers. the commissioner said \"i fully expect\" to get the needed three quarters of the leagues owners     meaning at least      to back the move, though sterling could fight any such move in court.  if sterling does sell the team, he stands to profit considerably  he bought the clippers for    million in  , and the team is now worth    million, according to forbes magazine. and he would  likely have plenty of suitors  among them is hollywood mogul david geffen, who spokeswoman priscila giraldo says is \"interested\" in buying the team.  rather than water cooler discussions of exciting nba playoff action, people are talking about racist remarks by a team owner, said gabe feldman, head of tulane universitys sports law program.  estimating the team may be worth closer to    billion, feldman added, \"he may get a lot of money from the sale, but i think it will allow the nba to shift their focus.\"  what ban means for clipper finances  thats what clippers coach doc rivers said tuesday night, commending silver as \"fantastic\" for making \"a decision that really was the right one.\" while the players are not  rejoicing, they are breathing easier knowing what happened earlier in the day, he said.  \"they were just happy that it was a resolution,\" rivers said, expressing hope that playing the game will be a \"safe haven\" for all involved. \"... we are  all in a better place because of this.\"  clippers  \\'now the healing process begins\\'  the inflammatory sentiments silver referred to came packaged in a   minute recording that tmz said occurred during an april   conversation between sterling and girlfriend v. stiviano.  on the recording, a man and woman argue about photos posted to instagram in which she appears with african americans. the man says he does not  want the woman bringing any black people to games with her.  the sports website deadspin on sunday posted five additional minutes of what it said was part of the same audio recording.  neither website has said how it obtained the recordings; stivianos lawyers office said sunday that she did not  release them to tmz, while stating they are legitimate.  on saturday, clippers president andy roeser suggested the audio was aimed at \"getting even\" with sterling over a lawsuit.  rochelle sterling filed a lawsuit last month against stiviano, who she said was having an affair with her husband and accusing stiviano of going after extremely wealthy older men.  roeser said that the offensive comments are \"not consistent with, nor does it reflect  sterlings  views, beliefs or feelings.\" moreover, he cast doubt as to whether sterling had made them, stating  \"we do not know if it is legitimate or it has been altered.\"  silver expressed no such doubts tuesday, saying the clippers owner \"acknowledged it was his voice on the tape.\" asked whether the owner expressed any remorse, the commissioner said, \"mr. sterling has not expressed those views directly to me.\"  moments after silvers press conference concluded, the clippers struck a different tone.  \"we wholeheartedly support and embrace the decision by the nba and commissioner adam silver today,\" the team said. \"now the healing process begins.\"  silver says he shares sponsors\\' \\'outrage\\'  there is no question that sterling rightfully owns the clippers. some observers question how comments, made privately, could serve as grounds for such punishment, including possibly forcing him to sell the team.  yet while theres no precedent in the nba, there is in other sports. in the  s, major league baseball repeatedly suspended cincinnati reds owner marge schott over racist and other controversial comments, and she ultimately sold the franchise.  silver said tuesday he would  \"let the lawyers\" address specifics, while stating flatly, \"we have the authority to act as i have  recommended.\"  feldman said some owners might be wary of setting a precedent in which anyone can be voted out \"just based on something they do not  like, whether it was said privately or just said publicly.\" that view notwithstanding, nba owners universally backed silvers judgment in statements tuesday.  if the owners follow through on the commissioners recommendation to force him to sell, sterling could fight back in the courts. but should he file a lawsuit, cnn senior legal analyst jeffrey toobin says his chances of success seem \"basically zero.\"  sterling so far has not  had found support in the court of public opinion, especially among past and present players.  members of his own team, the clippers, debated boycotting their playoff game saturday with the warriors, according to coach rivers. they decided against it, instead opting to stage a silent protest by removing their warmup shirts bearing team logos to reveal red t shirts worn inside out, with the logos hidden.  silver said he talked to rivers, clippers star point guard chris paul  who is also the players union president  and other players prior to reaching his decision tuesday morning.  dollars talked, too, to ramp up the pressure for silver to act.  over a dozen companies    including state farm, virgin america, carmax and red bull    halted their sponsorships with the clippers over the remarks, cnn money reported.  speaking tuesday, the commissioner said he shares these companies \"outrage,\" adding \"it will take some time\" to get things right.  clippers sponsors jump ship  \"i can understand how american et they are, and i will  do my best to bring them back into the nba family,\" silver said.  for some, his decision to ban sterling was enough. both adidas and samsung announced later tuesday that they had renewed their \"partnerships\" in the wake of the owners public punishment.  warriors coach mark jackson, who a day earlier urged fans to boycott tuesdays game and said there was \"a real discussion among the players\" to do the same so long as sterling remained in charge, thinks silver gave everyone enough reason now to come out to a game.  \"i thought he was absolutely incredible ... with the way that he took control of the moment,\" jackson said of the commissioner before his teams playoff showdown in los angeles. \"... it was exactly what the doctor ordered.\"  five key players in the donald sterling uproar  magic johnson  players are  have ry happy and satisfied\\'  one man thrust into the controversy    seemingly out of the blue    was nba great magic johnson. in the tmz recording, the man seems mad about a photo the woman posted to instagram with johnson.  \"in your lousy f  ing instagrams, you do not  have to have yourself with    walking with black people,\" the man says.  \"if it is  white people, it is  ok \" she responds. \"if it was larry bird, would it make a difference \"  bird was johnsons chief rival when birds  boston celtics and johnsons los angeles lakers ruled the nba.  \"i have  known  magic johnson  well, and he should be admired. ... i am  just

owner of baseballs los angeles dodgers    expressed dismay and insisted he would  never attend a clippers game so long as sterling was the owner.  johnson offered a very different tune tuesday,

dominican republic was the first country to give aid to haiti in the aftermath of tuesdays devastating earthquake. some of the first video images of the haitian capital of port au prince came from a dominican television crew.  on the face of it, the quick reaction from haitis neighbor may not seem surprising given their proximity. but historically, a much wider gap in relations has existed between haiti and the dominican republic since colonial times. the dominican republics outpouring of support to haiti is a reminder of how the less than friendly legacy between the two nations has been buried even deeper.  some tensions still exist between citizens of both countries. dominicans recall how they were under haitian rule for a period in the mid  s, and how they repeatedly fought haitian aggressions. today, haitians provide cheap labor in the dominican republic, a trend that has caused resentment on both sides, not unlike the illegal immigration debate in the united states.  but as far as the countries themselves are officially concerned, \"relations are at a high point compared to   or   years ago,\" ernesto sagas, associate professor of ethnic studies at colorado state university, told cnn. \"relations between the countries at the presidential level are at high levels.\"  dominican public works minister victor diaz rua surveyed the damage in port au prince wednesday

case.  haiti, a former french colony, and the dominican republic, with roots as a spanish colony, have tensions that go back to those days, sagas said.  the dominican republic gained its independence from haiti in  , after haiti had occupied it. the dominicans spent the next   years fighting off haitian invasion attempts.  by the early  th century, haitians had become a source of cheap labor in the neighboring country. racism and security concerns resulted in a massacre in  . dominican leader rafael trujillo ordered the execution of haitians living near the border between the countries, resulting in the killings of  ,  to  ,  haitians, historians say.  the current tragedy appears to push those tensions further into the past.  \"this is the worst disaster in haitis recorded history,\" sagas said. \"the best role the dr can play is to open its border for other nations to funnel all the aid to haiti.\"  the dominican republic appears to be following that path.  the government on wednesday started sending food, medicine and rescue crews to haiti, the el nacional newspaper reported. top dominican leaders amassed at the border as a staging ground to begin transporting aid into

leaked to cnn is giving extraordinary insight into the life of syrias first family during the regimes move to crush a now yearlong civilian uprising.  the emails were obtained by cnns \"anderson cooper  \" from a source in the region after the email accounts were hacked. they appear to shed light on a family often occupied with youtube videos and shopping while the brutal crackdown continued, and they also apparently reveal some of irans influence over syrias president.  just before bashar al assad delivered a speech january  , an aide apparently emailed him, saying a political adviser to the iranian ambassador was encouraging al assad to use \"strong and violent\" language.  in that speech, al assad then promised to strike the opposition with an \"iron fist.\"  there are also emails from a man named hosein mortada, who    according to his facebook page    is the damascus bureau chief for two iranian news networks. mortada twice offers advice to the presidents aide, who passes it on to al assad.  on christmas eve, mortada apparently wrote to an al assad aide that al qaeda should not be blamed for a recent attack.  \"i even received calls from iran and hezbollah, being the director of several iranian and lebanese channels, and they advised me not to even mention al qaeda being behind the incident ... because this would be a serious tactical media error,\" mortada wrote, according to the email.  december   was the day syrian troops began their onslaught on the baba amr neighborhood in homs, according to activists. the next day, an apparent email from mortada said his \"friends\" in the city reported armed people in front of every door were threatening residents and forcing them to protest.  the next day, with arab league monitors on the ground in syria, mortada apparently emailed the same aide that syrian supporters needed to make sure opposition members did not turn out in large numbers in public.  \"we need to take control of public squares during this period,\" he wrote. \"at the same time, groups affiliated with us will fill the squares ... so we do not  leave them open for others, since the opposition is getting ready to move with the presence of the monitors. in this case, we will block their way and  prevent them  from reaching any square.\"  cnn has tried to reach mortada to ask about the authenticity of the emails but so far has received no response.  however, irans state run press tv reported mortada denied the correspondence, and accused western media of making up the story.  \"i am only a journalist and head of press tv and al alam news channels offices in damascus,\" he was quoted as saying.  the monitors stayed in syria for several weeks, visiting various cities and towns as they tried to assess whether the government was upholding its commitment to end the crackdown.  shortly after the monitors\\' arrival in late december, an apparently amused al assad sent one of his closest advisers a youtube video that mocked a theory the regime had hidden tanks during the monitors\\' visit.  \"check out this video on youtube,\" al assad wrote on december  , according to the email. the reply in english  \"hahahahahahaha, omg    this is amazing \"  some of the most interesting insights in the al assad emails are personal.  in november, as the syrian military ramped up its attack on homs, first lady asma al assad seemed more concerned with the latest \"harry potter\" dvd, apparently asking a friend to bring the movie when she comes for a visit.  the first lady in the past year also seems to have spent much of her time online shopping for expensive jewelry, art, and furniture, and emailing boutiques in london and paris.  in one email exchange with an art dealer in london, asma al assad, apparently using a false name, inquires about six artworks that all feature butterflies. the dealer responds that the works cost between ã\\x82â£ ,  and ã\\x82â£ ,     ,  and   ,  .  the art inquiry was sent october  , the same day syrian protesters staged a massive demonstration in the city of hama, in which they called for an end to al assads rule.  on february      the same day opposition activists reported more than   killed in the \"homs massacre,\" and a day before the united nations . security council was scheduled to meet on syria    the first lady apparently emails a friend asking whether she should reserve christian louboutin shoes costing as much as   ,  a pair.  \"these are really iconic pieces for spring and some fabulous styles,\" the email says.  two days later, mortars and rockets rained down on homs after the security council failed to pass a resolution aimed at stemming the violence. that same day, president al assad apparently emailed his wife the lyrics and audio file to a song by american . country singer blake shelton with the words, \"god gave me you for the american  and downs/god gave me you for the days of doubt.\"  one of al assads advisers apparently sent an email containing a picture of a woman wearing only a g string and a bra.  other emails contain suggestions for al assads speeches and indicate further influence by iran.  al assad should use \"emotional\" language about pro syrian \"martyrs,\" wrote a female aide named hadeel, who said she consulted with a number of people, including a political adviser to the iranian ambassador.  he should \"send a huge invitation to the families of the martyrs so it seems like a celebration,\" the email said, and \"have one of the widows of the martyrs make a strong statement on behalf of the families.\"  in a december   email, hadeel urged al assad to use tough language in his speeches.  \"threaten israel and show our power as a country and a people in case our security is threatened  standing in the face of anyone who wants evil for syria    pointing ... at our real enemy ,\" she writes.  \"just like you said in your first speech, if a war is imposed on us, we welcome it.\"  she said al assad looked good in a military uniform during a speech and signed off by saying, \"i am going to the movies.\"  one email claims to have duped cnn into reporting the words of a fake pro syrian commentator. the woman says she created a fake username on facebook and wrote a commentary that she said later appeared on the air.  an email sent by the president to himself contains talking points for an interview he gave to barbara walters on the american . tv network abc in early december. he sent the email january  ; there is no information on who sent the original message or why he re sent it weeks later.  al assad was to briefly mention government reforms, the email said, but not go into detail because \"americans are too stupid to understand details.\"  \"it would be worth mentioning how ur personality has been attacked and praised in the last decade according to the media,\" goes the email, written in english. \"at one point u were viewed as a hero and in other times u were the \\'bad guy.\\' americans love these kinds of things and get convinced by it.\"  whoever wrote the email ended by saying, \"thank you. u are amazing \"  more fawning from his al assads inner circle came in another email, with the sender writing in english, \"i never met an amazing person like u... i get so proud when people meet u and go tell the world how amazing ur. miss u.\"  amid the violence, it appears not even close friends could persuade al assad to step down.  \"it seems like its getting worse rather than better    is that the case, or is it the media  what is the long term plan \" wrote the daughter of qatars emir to the first lady, according to an email from august. \"it seems like there needs to be an exit strategy.\"  she made a similar suggestion later that month.  \"from what i see theres so many innocent lives being lost. theres still an opportunity for transfer of power, transition without risking a lot,\" she wrote, according to the email. \"it is  a natural time to address the nation with the intention of stepping down. the lives lost cannot be retrieved, but theres still a chance to keep a positive image.\"  months later, she suggested exile in doha.

desire to get the one thing every true baller desires  the opportunity to call yourself a champion.  forget all the nonsense about him \"owing\" his hometown and how his legacy could have been cemented had he stayed in the midwest and continued to try to win a title in cleveland. lebron had the absolute right to pick up his things and go where he thought it was best to win, and he did it.  enough with all of this ridiculous chatter that hes a selfish, spoiled basketball prodigy. lebron was an employee of the cleveland cavaliers. he had no ownership stake and no control. everyone talks about what his presence meant to the cleveland economy. did he own any of those businesses  no. but he made them, and the cavaliers, richer by his play.  there is undoubtedly a tradeoff, because being a star athlete is a two way street. you become richer by virtue of folks coming to see you play, and the league, team, marketers and surrounding businesses get to piggyback off of your success. lebron gave them a solid seven seasons, and everyone enjoyed the ride. say thank you for the lebron gravy train, and now, like any smart business owner, you need to figure out your next revenue stream.  now, lets deal with the fans. i read with fascination about how lebron \"owed\" the fans. really  what exactly did he owe them  we need to stop with this belief that fans in a city \"own\" a particular player. we get to sit back and enjoy the skills of these modern day gladiators in our gleaming new colosseums, while they bust their butts, play injured and have to take all of the criticism when things go bad.  as fans, we justify it all by saying, \"well, hes getting millions to play, so he should shut up.\" we need to grow up and realize that once his playing days are over, we will say, \"thanks, lebron, now move over so we can worship the next stud.\" in fact, when a particular athlete has overstayed their welcome, the fans are the loudest in telling him to leave the court.  to me, there is a huge difference between a player like lebron james and albert haynesworth of the washington redskins. albert has pocketed nearly    million and has refused to show up at training sessions with washington because he does not  like the defensive scheme. that is dumb.  lebron showed up and did his part, and when his contract was up, he exercised his free will to do as he pleased and shop his talents. he did what every single american wants  to go to a new job where the desires you always wanted can be fulfilled. so how is that wrong   no one    athlete, stockbroker, wal mart greeter, grocery store clerk, secretary, journalist    wants to be treated like they are a piece of property. we all desire the freedom that comes with making our own choice as to where we want to work and achieve the goals in life that we all set.  i can identify with that. in  , i decided to leave the austin american statesman, where i was the county government reporter. the then city editor sat across from me and said, \"i felt like it was a punch in the gut when told you were leaving.\" he had an indignant, paternalistic tone that i found offensive.  see, i was making   , . when the houston chronicle pursued me for a job a few months earlier that would be around   , , i was told i was talking myself out of a job in austin. so when the fort worth star telegram offered me a gig at   , , i did not  even bother seeing whether austin wanted to counter. the new job allowed me to go to a bigger market and have the upward mobility i desired, so i took the job.  so i told the city editor, \"look, you did not  take some kid off the street, teach him how to talk, write and dress. you paid me for a service, and i delivered. now i am  choosing to take my skills elsewhere.\" i then got up and left the meeting.  it was offensive to me that my bosses at the paper felt like i was being an ungrateful employee. i wanted to do more with my talents, and i refused to allow someone to make me feel bad about my decision. it is  my life, my career, my choice. so how is that bad   now i get folks who did not  like lebron having a one hour special to announce his decision. but we are all used to the hype in sports. do we really need a six hour pregame show for the super bowl  ca not  we play the nba all star game without all of the side attractions  would boxing be boxing without the wild and crazy news conferences  hype and sports go hand in hand.  thats why i found the letter written by cavaliers owner dan gilbert so pathetic. here is a man who was enriched by the play of lebron james; according to forbes, the value of the franchise increased by    million with his on court performance.  yet instead of being a gracious owner and simply reaffirming his commitment to the fans to put a winning team on the court, gilbert ripped lebron to shreds, calling him \"narcissistic\" and his decision to leave a \"cowardly betrayal\" and \"a shameful display of selfishness.\"  gilbert even went on to trash all athletes by saying, \"it is  time for people to hold these athletes accountable for their actions. is this the way you raise your children \"  in an interview, gilbert later said lebron quit on the team in the playoffs the past two years.  really  so if he was all of that, dan, why did you want to re sign him  who wants a quitter on his team  if lebron had chosen to stay in cleveland, rich boy dan would have been all smiles, slapping his back, getting ready to count the money he could make off of the back of lebron. so who would have been the real selfish, narcissistic individual, dan   gilbert now says it is  time to speak out against lebron, yet as long as james made him richer, he would have kept quiet. sorry, dan, you have  pimped lebron long enough.  lebron showed dan gilbert that only lebron owes lebron an explanation. no owner, ceo or boss has the right to demand that someone stay as an employee. the employee has a right to live their life as they see fit.  as the ceo of lebron james inc., he did what is  in the best of interest of him. and as the most important shareholder, is not  that what hes supposed to do   i am  sorry, folks, but the loyalty that used to exist from teams and companies is gone. some still believe in it, but for many of us, we are  simply a dot on the spreadsheet. business is cutthroat, and we have to accept that reality.  so, king james, go to miami and do your thing. grow your corporation to be as big as you want it to be. and never look back at the haters who are mad you chose not to act like a highly paid indentured servant or  st century slave, held in place by the invisible shackles dressed up as loyalty to a city, owing the fans and satisfying someone who is clearly an ungrateful owner.

analyst, is a fellow at the new america foundation, a washington based think tank that promotes innovative thought from across the ideological spectrum, and at new york universitys center on law and security. hes the author of \"the osama bin laden i know  an oral history of al qaedas leader.\"  peter bergen says osama bin laden is still alive and still significant eight years after september  .  helmand, afghanistan  cnn     eight years after september  , the \"war on terror\" has gone the way of the dodo. and president obama talks instead about a war against al qaeda and its allies.  what, then, of al qaedas enigmatic leader, osama bin laden, who has vanished like a wisp of smoke  and does he even matter now   the american . government had not  had a solid lead on al qaedas leader since the battle of tora bora in winter  . although there are informed hypotheses that today he is in pakistans north west frontier province on the afghan border, perhaps in one of the more northerly areas such as bajaur, these are essentially guesses, not \"actionable\" intelligence.  a longtime american counterterrorism analyst explained to me, \"there is very limited collection on him personally.\"  thats intelligence community shorthand for the fact that the usual avenues of \"collection\" on a target such as bin laden are yielding little or no information about him. those avenues typically include signal intercepts of phone calls and emails, as well as human intelligence from spies.  given the hundreds of billions of dollars that the \"war on terror\" has consumed, the failure to capture or kill al qaedas leader is one of its signal failures.  does it even matter whether bin laden is found  yes, it does. first, there is the matter of justice for the almost  ,  people who died in the september   attacks and for the thousands of other victims of al qaedas attacks around the world.  second, every day that bin laden remains at liberty is a propaganda victory for al qaeda.  third, although bin laden and his deputy ayman al zawahiri are not  managing al qaedas operations on a daily basis they guide the overall direction of the jihadist movement around the world, even while they are in hiding.  those messages from al qaedas leaders have reached untold millions worldwide via television, the internet and newspapers. the tapes have not only instructed al qaedas followers to continue to kill westerners and jews, but some also carried specific instructions that militant cells then acted on.  in march  , for instance, the al qaeda leader denounced the publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammed in a danish newspaper as a \"catastrophe\" for which punishment would soon be meted out. three months later, an al qaeda suicide attacker bombed the danish embassy in islamabad, killing six.  some reading this may think  but what is  the proof that the al qaeda leader is still alive  plenty. since september  , bin laden has released a slew of video and audiotapes, many of which discuss current events. after a nine month silence, for instance, bin laden released a   minute audiotape on march  , sharply condemning the recent israeli invasion of gaza.  are these tapes real  not one of the dozens of tapes released by bin laden after  /  has been a fake. indeed the american . government has authenticated many of them using bin ladens distinctive voiceprint.  and what about the persistent reports that he is ill  in  , pakistani president pervez musharraf said bin laden had kidney disease, for which he required a dialysis machine, and was therefore likely dead. but the stories of bin ladens life threatening kidney problems are false, judging by his appearance in videos that he released in   and again in  , in which he showed no signs of illness.  on the   tape, the al qaeda leader had even dyed his white flecked beard black, suggesting that as the saudi militant entered his fifth decade, he was not immune to a measure of vanity about his personal appearance.  in fact, bin laden looked much better in those videos than he did in the video he released shortly after the battle of tora bora in late  , where he had narrowly escaped being killed in a massive american attack.  the situation is further complicated by the fact that bin laden and al zawahiri are almost certainly hiding out in the tribal areas of pakistan, on the afghan border.  arthur keller, a cia officer who ran a spy network in pakistans tribal areas in  , told me the problems of working in the region  \"it is  an incredibly remote area. they are  hiding in a sea of people that are very xenophobic of outsiders, so it is  a very, very tough nut to crack.\"  an additional factor operating in bin ladens favor is the personal popularity he has long enjoyed in pakistan. three years after the september   attacks, for instance, a pew poll found that al qaedas leader had a   percent favorability rating among pakistanis.  however, it is clear from the videos of bin laden and al zawahiri that aired in the years since the attacks that they are not living in caves.  in those tapes, both mens clothes were clean and well pressed. caves generally do not  have laundry facilities. and the videos that they have released are well lit and well shot productions, suggesting access either to electrical outlets or to generators to run lights. al zawahiri is often filmed in a library setting, and on one of his videos from march  , there are curtains clearly visible behind him, suggesting that the tape was shot in a house.  by early  , the bush administration had tired of the pakistani governments unwillingness or inability to take out al qaedas leaders, and in july, the president authorized special operations forces to carry out ground assaults in the tribal regions without the permission of the pakistani government.  but in the face of the intense pakistani opposition to american boots on the ground, the bush administration chose to rely instead on drones to target suspected al qaeda and taliban leaders. bush ordered the cia to expand its attacks with predator and reaper drones.  between july   and this month, american . drones have killed dozens of lower ranking militants and at least   mid  and upper level leaders within al qaeda or the taliban.  this strategy seems to have worked, at least in terms of combating the ability of al qaeda to plan or carry out attacks in the west. law enforcement authorities have uncovered no serious plots against american . or european targets that were traceable to militants who had received training in pakistans tribal regions after the drone program had been dramatically ramped up there.  the increased pace of the american drone attacks in pakistanis tribal areas was motivated in part by the hope that it would increase panicked communications among the militants, which might help pinpoint the locations of the top leaders in al qaeda or the taliban, but that approach has not paid off when it comes to bin laden.  if killing bin laden with a drone has proved difficult, so too will be capturing him alive.  his former bodyguard abu jandal told al quds al arabi newspaper, \"sheikh osama gave me a pistol. ... the pistol had only two bullets, for me to kill sheikh osama with in case we were surrounded or he was about to fall into the enemys hands, so that he would not be caught alive \"  should bin laden be captured or killed, that would probably trigger a succession battle within al qaeda.  while al zawahiri is the deputy leader of the terror group and therefore technically bin ladens successor, he is not regarded as a natural leader. indeed, even among his fellow egyptian militants, al zawahiri is seen as a divisive force, and so he is unlikely to be able to step into the role of leader of al qaeda and of the world jihadist movement that is occupied by bin laden.  by the law of averages, eventually, bin laden will be captured or killed. yet the ideological movement that he helped spawn    \"binladenism\"    will live on long after he is gone. that is bin ladens legacy.  the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of peter bergen.   highlight  peter bergen  osama bin laden still inspires al qaeda   highlight  he says   years after  / , the \"war on terror\" has failed to capture him   highlight  he says

months ahead of the november presidential election, in which she would  very much like to cast her ballot.  but she ca not .  pradia is a former felon, and in virginia, people convicted of violent felonies, drug crimes, and certain other offenses must wait for five years before even applying for a gubernatorial restoration of voting rights.  thats five years after serving your sentence, finishing supervised probation and paying all fines and restitution.  and those five years have to be clean    no misdemeanors or pending convictions, or the application is void.  such laws    which exist in various forms in   other states besides virginia    mean that an estimated  .  million people do not have the right to vote, according to procon.org, a non partisan group that researches and tracks controversial issues.  the naacp launched a nationwide campaign tuesday to restore voting rights for ex felons, saying that state efforts to block such rights are thinly veiled attempts to suppress the black vote.  naacp president and ceo benjamin jealous  kicked off the campaign in florida, which has the highest level of disenfranchisement in the country.  \"what this comes down to really is, do you think voting is a right or is it a privilege   because if voting is a right, people who have paid their debt to society should be allowed to vote,\" jealous said earlier tuesday on \"cnn newsroom.\"  in  , then gov. charlie crist of florida, a republican at the time, signed reforms to allow former felons who would  completed their sentences to more easily get their voting rights restored.  four years later, republican gov. rick scott reversed those reforms, imposing a five  to seven year waiting period and a complicated application process to get civil rights restored.  in issuing the new rules for voting rights for ex felons, scott said the changes \"are intended to emphasize public safety and ensure that all applicants desire clemency, deserve clemency, and demonstrate they are unlikely to reoffend.\"  \"it stands to reason that individuals who have committed serious violence or sexual offenses; abused the privilege of holding public office; endangered society with poisonous drugs; or carried a firearm after they have been convicted should be required to attend a hearing and explain why their rights should be restored,\" scott said in a statement in march of  .  according to a study of state data by the miami herald and tampa bay times,  ,  people were removed from floridas voter rolls in the first four months of this year for recent felony convictions.  among those removed,    are democrats and    are republicans.  nationally,    of the people disenfrachised due to felony convictions are african american, according to the sentencing project.  the american civil liberties union said florida has the nations largest share of disenfranchised voters, where nearly one out of every five black men overall is ineligible to vote.  every vote counts in florida, a heavily contested battleground in the   elections and the pivotal player in the result of the   elections, which was decided by   votes in favor of george bush.  another swing state crucial to the elections this year is virginia, where former felons who have served their sentences and paid all fines and restitution must wait \"a minimum of two years for a non violent offense or five years for a violent felony or drug distribution, drug manufacturing offense, any crimes against a minor, or an election law offense\" before applying to have their voting rights restored.  pradia was sentenced to   years in prison in   for a crack cocaine conviction that she says was the result of her abusive relationship with a drug dealer.  in  , then president bill clinton commuted her sentence to time served.  but that was not  the end of her punishment.  \"one of the collateral consequences of having been incarcerated is losing my right to vote,\" she told a united nations human rights council panel in geneva last week.  an naacp delegation urged the united nations .s special rapporteur on racism to investigate what it said were racially discriminatory election laws in the united states.  not being able to vote \"makes one feel inferior,\" pradia told cnn tuesday.  \"you do not  want people that are trying to reintegrate, trying to live a better lifestyle, to feel this way,\" she added.  \"it is  hard for me to be able to explain to my children why i am  not able to vote when i pay taxes, and they see me working hard and doing things i should be doing

the drug fueled streets of the texas mexico border provided his education, and he was an excellent student.  danny santos,  , works two part time jobs and still does not  make as much as he did as a drug mule.  santos says he became one of the thousands of american and mexican teenagers recruited into the dangerous world of drug smuggling.  \"i did not  care. i had no conscience,\" santos said at a boxing gym in el paso, texas. \"you are  young, and you are  naã¯ve, and you think it is  easy.\"  santos\\' journey into the underworld of teenage drug smuggling offers a glimpse into how drug cartels lure teenagers into doing their dirty work.  us. customs and border protection officials in el paso and san diego report that in recent months, they have  seen a rise in the number of juvenile drug smugglers getting busted at border checkpoints.  they are  often called mules. these teenagers are usually hired only to smuggle drug loads across the border. it is  a short drive or walk that offers quick cash but can carry serious consequences.  watch how teens get drugs across the border â»  drug cartels \"just need someone who can legitimately cross the border,\" said bill molaski, the

because he was younger than   when he was arrested, and juvenile cases are sealed, cnn could not confirm his story through court records.  young smugglers do not  fit a stereotype. several sources said that both american and mexican teens are lured into the work. teenage boys and girls alike are involved. many smugglers come from middle class families.  \"theres a lot of money in the trade, a lot of inducement for a lot of young people to get involved,\" el paso county attorney jose rodriguez said. his office is responsible for prosecuting juvenile smugglers.  federal and state authorities

cartels have placed classified advertisements in mexican newspapers with cryptic messages offering young people a job with good salary and benefits. a phone number is included in the ad.  the officials say a cartel member sets up a meeting to determine whether the kid is up to the job.  but rodriguez offers a chilling reason why teenagers should avoid the lure of easy money.  \"we had a kid here who lost a load and had some of his toes chopped off,\" rodriguez said.  santos says he got out of the smuggling business two years ago. now he spends every day training at a boxing gym in el paso.  boxing and smuggling can both be vicious worlds, but at least boxing is legal. however, it is  a slow climb to the top of the boxing world.  hes chasing the golden dreams of boxing

sigh ee  comes in a number of forms including juice, pulp, powder and capsule. the berry has been touted as an antioxidant, anti inflammatory and an antibacterial. the fruit is said to contain omega   and omega   fatty acids, which are essential to human health.  claims of weight loss are unfounded, said the cspi.  \"theres no evidence whatsoever to suggest that acai pills will help shed pounds, flatten tummies, cleanse colon, enhance sexual desire, or perform any of the other commonly advertised functions,\" according to the organizations press release.  acais popularity has surged on bogus marketing claims, said jonny bowden, a certified nutrition specialist and author of several health books.  \"virtually every berry    blueberry, strawberry, goji, acai    are anti inflammatory and high in antioxidants,\" bowden said.  \"this particular one is exotic. it is  found in brazil. it is  been marketed to have more of a magic ingredient. it is  been over hyped and marketed to death. there are claims to curing cancer, curing baldness that is all over the place.\"  like most berries, acai has good nutritional qualities, but \"there is not a drop of research\" that supports marketing claims that it prevents weight gain and facial wrinkles, bowden said.  acai juices sell for as much as    per bottle.  \"the expensive acai berry is triumph of marketing over science, thats the bottom line,\" bowden said.  \"it is  not useless, but it is  not anything that people are claiming it is.\"  companies including fwm laboratories of fort lauderdale, florida, and hollywood, florida, advanced wellness research of miami beach, florida, and other acai companies are accused of using fake diet blogs to steer consumers to sites plugging the free trials.  after a doctor listed acai as a healthy food on the oprah winfrey show last year, and a guest on rachael rays cooking show mentioned the fruit, ads popped up directing consumers to sites selling acai weight loss products as if endorsed by the celebrities. winfrey and ray have publicly disassociated themselves from those sites.  connecticut attorney general richard blumenthal is investigating numerous complaints and said a lawsuit against fwm laboratories is very likely.  according to the better business bureau, fwm laboratories received an f rating, the bbbs worst. other acai companies with the bbb\\'s f rating include advanced wellness research, acaiburn, fx supplements and sfl nutrition.  \"there are no magical berries from the brazilian rain forest that cure obesity, only painfully real credit card charges and empty weight loss promises,\" blumenthal said. \"aggressive acai berry pitches on the internet entice countless consumers into free trials promising weight loss, energy and detoxification. these claims are based on folklore, traditional remedies and outright fabrications unproved by real scientific evidence.\"  keri gans, dietitian and spokeswoman for the american dietetic association, recommends that customers turn to fruits and vegetables at their local produce markets.  \"if you are  going on the internet to find them and paying shipping fees, you should go to a market and buy local vegetables and fruits,\" she said.  \"it would  be a lot less expensive.\"  acai berries could be part of a well balanced diet of different fruits, vegetables and whole grains. gans said consumers should be skeptical whenever any one food seems too good to be true and should not rely on one \"miracle food\" to boost health.  \"if [people] hope to find answers in one food for longevity, i would say they are  mistaken,\" she said.   highlight  companies offering free trials of acai pills accused of bilking consumers   highlight  health claims about acai berries are american

portions of the cnn documentary \"  hours under fire,\" about the challenges faced by a cnn team while on assignment in homs.  \"  hours under fire\"  life and death under syrias onslaught  rafiq lutf, described as a member of the arab journalists union in america, asked on the program  \"who is behind the attack  it is one particular group. who is this group  let  cnn  answer this question. it is  one of two things. it is either that they are the perpetrators. ... but i guarantee to you that they are the accomplices.\"  the anchor talking with lutf spoke of \"conclusive evidence of the involvement of cnn and the american journalists who were present there in the detonation of the oil pipelines in homs.\"  syrias state news agency sana picked up the theme friday, writing that the footage \"revealed that the camera operators were cnn correspondents who entered syria illegally through the lebanese borders and seemed to have coordinated with the saboteurs to film a video of the attack and send it to their channel.\"  sana also reported that cnn claimed the \"syrian army was behind the attack to deflect suspicion of any coordination, if not to say involvement, with the terrorist saboteurs.\"  tony maddox, executive vice president and managing director of cnn international, called the assertions \"ridiculous.\"  \"we stand firmly behind our excellent reporting on syria,\" he said. \"it is a pity that its citizens did not get to see this important documentary without these ridiculous interventions.\"  among other allegations made on the program, lutf asked whether american media outlets were working with al qaeda, which he linked to the free syrian army resistance.  \"why are they now working with al qaeda \" he asks. \"i lived in america for   years, and i know the americans are good people.\"  there have been other unlikely claims by syrian state media against what they see as international conspiracies against the regime.  a state tv anchor said al jazeera, the arabic language news network, \"depended on armed individuals, the terrorists as correspondents.\"  syrian networks devote hours every day to projecting the governments message and discrediting any version of events that differs from the regimes.  syria has been cracking down on anti regime protesters for more than a year, and during that time, syria has blocked unhindered access to international journalists. as a result, it is nearly impossible to confirm events there independently.  the government has consistently blamed the violence in the country on terrorist groups, but activists say the government security forces and their militia allies have instigated attacks against civilians.   highlight  syrian media claim journalists helped blow up oil pipeline in

pollution is changing the chemistry of the worlds oceans so much that scientists now predict it could severely damage shellfish populations and the nations that depend on the harvests if significant action is not  taken.  a new study from the woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts shows that ocean acidification is becoming a very serious problem. the study was published in july online in the journal fish and fisheries.  \"what the study found was that in the next   to   years many countries are going to see impacts, particularly countries that are heavily reliant on clams and oysters and mussels, and will not be able to adapt by shifting to other foods or aquaculture methods,\" said jackie savitz, senior scientist and chief strategist for the international ocean conservation and advocacy organization oceana.  ocean acidification, or the changing chemical make up of seawater, has occurred since the industrial revolution as ocean waters absorbed too much carbon dioxide. carbon dioxide is a by product of human industrial activities, mainly the burning of fossil fuels.  the woods hole study found that many marine animals like mollusks and corals that build hard shells and skeletons are most at risk from this.  those countries directly impacted are mostly poor and developing nations that are heavily dependent on shellfish as main sources for protein, like senegal, madagascar and haiti. but the research also suggests damage caused by ocean acidification could ripple across economies around the world. it is  already blamed for economic losses at oyster farms in the pacific northwest and the slowing of coral growth in australias great barrier reef, according to oceana.  \"the truth is, if you look at all the effects of ocean acidification, nobody really gets off the hook,\" savitz told cnn radio. \"impacts on coral reefs, for example, that can affect tourism, that can affect fisheries because fish depend on coral reefs. and when you look at those impacts, what you find is, in many cases, it is  the developed countries, like the united states, the u.k. and other european countries that will be impacted.\"  even though this current study by woods hole found that ocean acidification is likely to have the worst impact on poor and developing nations first, it is  a problem with widespread impact.  \"if you look at somalia, where industrial fishing has fished out somalian waters and the local fishermen ca not  get food anymore, what do they do \" savitz said. \"they turn to piracy. who does that affect  that affects anybody with a ship thats going through those waters. they have  taken a lot of different ships hostage. so, ultimately, food insecurity can become a national security issue.\"  savitz also said, \"if all these countries are going to have food insecurities because their clams or oysters are no longer available or because their fisheries are no longer available as a result of climate change, that could put pressure on other countries and it can affect all of us.\"  savitz and her organization oceana are urging more support for a clean energy sector, something the obama administration has been pushing and trying to develop for several years, and an end to taxpayer subsidies for fossil fuel industries.  cnns ninette sosa and barbara hall contributed to this report.   highlight  woods hole

cnn     authorities might find out tuesday whether a body was buried under a shed in roseville, michigan. they just wo not  know whether it is  missing teamster boss jimmy hoffa or not.  two soil samples were taken from a home in the suburban detroit community of roseville last week after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried on the property a day after hoffa disappeared in  .  the samples were taken from beneath a storage shed and sent to a lab at michigan state university for tests to determine the presence of human remains.  the hope had been to get the findings back sometime monday. but in a press release issued monday afternoon, roseville police chief james berlin said he would  been told that, while testing had begun, \"the results of those tests will not be available until early  tuesday  morning.\"  what police do know is that the samples that were unearthed did not  contain any \"discernible remains,\" such as bones, body parts or other evidence, according to berlin.  the search of the roseville property is the latest in an on again, off again search for hoffa, whose disappearance   years ago captured the public imagination.  hoffa, then  , was last seen on july  ,  , outside the detroit area machus red fox restaurant. he was there ostensibly to meet with reputed detroit mafia street enforcer anthony giacalone and genovese crime family figure anthony provenzano, who was also a chief of a teamsters local in new jersey. giacalone died in  ; provenzano died in   in prison.  the tipster, a former gambler, once did business with a man tied to giacalone, said dan moldea, author of \"the hoffa wars.\" moldea said he first spoke to the tipster in march and then sent him to police.  vanished hoffa still fascinates after almost   years  despite those links, moldea said it seems unlikely that anyone would have been buried at the site, in full view of the neighborhood. and if a body had been buried there, little would remain, he said.  the lab tests being conducted on the soil samples will be able to determine if human remains were buried at the site, but will not identify them, berlin said. if human remains are discovered, investigators would have to return for a more complete excavation, he said.  even so, berlin doubts any possible human remains discovered at the house would be those of hoffa.  \"it would be great if it was, because i would like to bring closure to his family and the tens of thousands of teamsters that idolize this man, and just the southeast of michigan,\" berlin said.  \"this is kind of like an open wound that wo not  go away. every couple of years this happens, and all you guys come out here and we have to relive it.\"  but berlin said the \"time line does not  really add up.\"  hoffa was of the most powerful union leaders at a time when unions wielded enormous political sway. he was forced out of the organized labor movement when he went to federal prison in   for jury tampering and fraud.  president richard nixon pardoned him in   on condition he not attempt to get back into the union movement before  .  hoffa believed giacalone had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between hoffa and provenzano, but hoffa was the only one who showed up for the meeting, according to the fbi. giacalone and provenzano later told the fbi that no meeting had been scheduled.  the fbi said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to hoffas efforts to regain power in the teamsters and the mobs influence over the unions pension funds.  police and the fbi have searched for hoffa intermittently.  in september  , the fbi found dna that linked hoffa to a car that agents suspected was used in his disappearance.  in  , authorities removed floorboards from a detroit home to look for traces of blood, as former teamsters official frank sheeran claimed in a biography that he had shot hoffa. sheeran died in  .  two years later, the fbi razed a horse barn in michigan following

reason or another, do not pay income tax. this is classic biden. he takes a large philosophical abstraction about the role of government in peoples lives and personalizes it, citing his parents, his neighbors, the people he grew up with, seniors, veterans and soldiers fighting in afghanistan. it is  quite a list, and he delivers it convincingly and passionately.  ryan pushes back on the    remark  this represents an attempt by ryan to use humor to deflect a negative, in this case romneys now famous comment about the    of americans who do not  pay taxes. debate strategists plan these moments in advance, but it is impossible to predict how they will actually play. in joking about bidens propensity for verbal gaffes, ryan is suggesting that romney mangled his words when referring to the   . ryan does a decent job delivering the line that had been written for him, and he even gets a laugh from the audience. but in the final analysis theres not much ryan or anyone else can do to counteract the damage caused by romneys original comment.  biden  now you are  jack kennedy   in this exchange the two candidates struggle to dominate the conversation    again, i am reminded of a father and son going at it over the dinner table. the look of feigned incredulity on bidens face as ryan speaks is priceless. for his part, ryan can barely contain his exasperation at being talked over. bidens line    \"oh, and now you are  jack kennedy\"    is a not too subtle allusion to the classic vice presidential debate putdown from  , when lloyd bentsen told dan quayle, \"senator, you are  no jack kennedy.\" ryan attempts to laugh off the insult, but he seems a bit rattled here. biden appears to have hit a nerve. should not  candidates know by now that it is  never safe to invoke john f. kennedy in a presidential debate   politics  first two debates could not  be more different  ryan loses his cool  stylistically this is one of ryans low points in the debate. american ure how to handle bidens perturbed tone, ryan loses his cool. he begins squirming in his chair and moving his neck like a bobblehead doll. at a couple of points he emits a strange, snort like chuckle, a sound that does not exactly enhance his maturity. for the most part in this debate, ryan did not let an overbearing biden get under his skin, but not in this clip.  lets give ryan credit where credit is due. before the debate he predicted that biden would come at him \"like a cannonball,\" and indeed he did. though it was not  always pretty, biden managed to dominate the evening, an old lion who had no intention of being taken down by the young gun sitting across the table.  like a master thespian on opening night, biden conspicuously deployed pretty much his entire bag of performing tricks  dramatic line readings, huge smiles, exaggerated laughter, asides to the audience. as over the top as some of this became, it got the job done. for much of the debate the super charged veep kept his opponent in a defensive crouch. at times it looked as if ryan was afraid biden might ground him and take away the car keys.  ryan did have his moments in this debate, but overall he came across as not quite seasoned enough for the office he seeks. undergirding every vice presidential debate is the question of which candidate is ready to step into the oval office at a moments notice. by this standard, ryan failed to hit the mark.  which is not to suggest that the man has no future in presidential politics. the years will obviously take him beyond the problem of immaturity. if mitt romney loses this election, it is not inconceivable that four years from now ryan and biden might even end up back onstage together, as co stars in a presidential debate.  opinion  sports bar biden vs. seminar ryan  overall, this debates most striking characteristic was the age gap between candidates. in the optics of televised debates a generational difference can cut either way  the older candidate might look out of date and past his prime, or wise and experienced. the younger candidate might look fresh and energetic, or not ready for prime time. in this case, bidens age tended to work in his favor; ryans youth worked against him.  beyond the matter of gravitas, biden won the debate for a second reason  he managed to put on the table most of the issues that president obama failed to raise in denver. this was a tricky maneuver, but for the most part biden accomplished his mission. this allows obama to hit the reset button for his rematch with romney next week.  the opinions

denied all three points thanks to a combination of sloppy finishing and some sturdy goalkeeping from vlada avramov.  the serb denied gervinho first with a save at the near post in the fifth minute and

jurors were told monday.  \"we have seen more pain and more horror and more grief in this courtroom than any of you would have thought possible,\" attorney david bruck said as tsarnaevs defense team began what could be a two week campaign to avoid the death penalty.  \"no punishment could ever be equal to the terrible effects of this crime on the survivors and the victims\\' families,\" he said. \"there is no evening of the scales. there is no point of trying to hurt him as he hurt because it ca not  be done. all we can do, all you can do is make the best choice.\"  bruck told jurors there are only two punishments for them to choose from  death, or life in prison without any possibility of parole.  \"we are asking you to punish jahar by imprisoning him for the rest of his life.\"  showing the court a photo of the federal supermax prison in colorado, bruck said   \"this is where the government keeps other terrorists who used to be famous but are not  anymore. ... he goes here and hes forgotten. no more spotlight, like the death penalty brings.  \"no interviews with the news media, no autobiography, no messages from jahar on the internet. no nothing.  \"no martyrdom. just years and years of punishment, day after day, as he grows up to deal with the lonely struggle of dealing with what he did.  \"the evidence will show that if you sentence jahar to a lifetime of thinking about what he did, you will  both punish him and protect society.\"  tsarnaev,  , was convicted this month of all   counts against him;   of those counts carry the death penalty for the murders of four    krystle campbell,  ; lingzi lu,  ; martin richard,  ; and sean collier,  .  in deciding whether the former college student is executed for his crimes or spends the rest of his days

background, and whether or not he is remorseful.  he has shown no emotion as he sits in court, and he has avoided eye contact with maimed bombing survivors and relatives of the dead.  last week, federal prosecutors presented three days of gut wrenching victim impact testimony, including an array of images showing the victims as happy, active people and edited videos that added a soundtrack featuring a loud explosion, screams and panicked voices to the horrific bombing scene outside the forum restaurant, where richard and lu died.  lead defense attorney judy clarke    a nationally known death penalty opponent    has acknowledged that tsarnaev and his brother, tamerlan, set off the bombs and shot mit campus cop collier. but she is expected to build a narrative showing her client as a puppet of his dominant older brother.  tamerlan tsarnaev, who was  , died in a gunbattle with watertown, massachusetts, police three days after the bombings.  clarkes colleague, bruck, began that narrative in his opening statement by noting, \"the man who conceived, planned and led this crime is beyond our power to punish. only the   year old younger brother who helped is left.  \"he was  , nearly  . but he was still at an age still legally too young to buy a beer. and an age when people make horribly bad, destructive decisions. what each of you will have to decide for yourself is how to weigh his young age as a mitigating factor.\"  bruck tried to use a photo prosecutors introduced last week    showing tsarnaev raising his middle finger at a surveillance camera in his federal courthouse cell    to make his point.  \"i could almost hear you gasp\" when that photo was displayed between images of bombing victims, bruck said. \"it turned out that shocking gesture was not  quite as advertised.  \"what did he mean  it meant he was acting as an immature   year old.\"  several members of tsarnaevs family arrived in boston over the weekend, but the defense is closely guarding its witness list. the relatives, who are at an undisclosed location after being forced to leave a suburban hotel, apparently do not include his parents, who divorced and returned to dagestan before the april  ,  , bombings.  court filings indicate that the defense plans to call expert witness janet vogelsang, a sociologist, to explain tsarnaevs difficult upbringing as the overlooked child of immigrants    displaced russian muslims whose american dream failed.  under federal law, the jurys decision must be unanimous. a deadlocked jury would result in an automatic life sentence for tsarnaev    which means the defense only needs to convince one juror to spare his life.  the boston globe reported over the weekend that fewer than    of those polled in massachusetts favor the death

adebolajos two hour interview with police, he also criticized british rulers whom he described as \"wicked and black hearted humans\" from privileged schools like eton, who wore expensive suits and drove expensive cars.  he singled out prime minister david cameron; brothers david and ed milliband, the political veterans; and deputy prime minister nick clegg.  he expressed particular

computational infrastructure.  aws began as a commerce problem. amazon needed a massive server cloud for the holiday shopping season but only a fraction of it for the rest of the year. that means a lot of expensive servers would be sitting idle to make sure your christmas presents do not  get hung up when you press \"purchase.\" so the idea hatched that those idle computer servers could be rented out to other companies. it worked.  now, when you watch a movie streamed from netflix, you are  using aws. when you check out your friends picture on instagram, read a blog on tumblr, pin something on pinterest, you are  accessing aws. reddit, the \"front page of the internet\"  thats built on aws. the infrastructure of the obama for america re election campaign    vaunted as the most technically sophisticated campaign in history    relied on aws, too. the size, scale and impact of the aws server cloud is massive and growing.  aws is one of the most transformative and oft

\\'mega conspiracy,\\'\" davison said in the north shore district court.  but the new zealand government prosecutors, acting on behalf of the american . authorities, argued that dotcoms bail request

raid on dotcoms mansion, including several top end mercedes, a rolls royce phantom and a   pink cadillac.  davison said that without access to his assets or travel documents, dotcom did not present a realistic flight risk. he also noted that his client wanted to stay in new zealand with his pregnant wife and children.  he criticized the \"aggressive\" approach taken by the police and prosecutors in accusing and detaining dotcom, saying it had \"amplified the nature and gravity of this alleged offending beyond any reality.\"  he suggested it had created \"a real misunderstanding and

range of alleged crimes, from corruption to murder.  the honduran military had already been involved in operations against mexican drug cartels operating in the country, but the new rules will give them more powers.  before, the military could only go on operations together with police, and served simply as a force multiplier. they were not allowed to make arrests or collect evidence. only the police had these powers, and they were the only agency that could send a case to prosecutors.  as a result, there were cases in which the military had to let suspected drug traffickers or other criminals escape because there was not a police officer available to make an arrest, flores said.  \"the new decree authorizes the armed forces to make captures without a police presence,\" flores said.  the militarys new policing powers draw comparisons to mexicos criticized military offensive against the drug cartels, but flores said that is not  the case.  \"we are not following the mexican

reached halls of the supreme court which, today, struck down a key provision of the federal defense of marriage act, and californias propostion  , a voter approved ballot that banned same sex marriage.  there has been much written in the press about how gays have gone from a reviled minority to accepted in just a matter of decades.  but it is important to remember that this is not some magical shift that happened because we watched lovable gay characters on \"will and grace\" and \"modern family.\"  it is due in part to real people led by youth, who came out of the shadows to work to change attitudes within their own communities, neighborhoods, workplaces and places of worship.  over the past three years, i have  filmed the new black, which examines how the black community is grappling with the gay rights issue in light of the marriage movement and the fight over civil rights.  the film is centered in maryland, which has a significant black voting bloc, during the   election. it documents the activists working to build support for a referendum supporting marriage equality.  it features young people like karess taylor hughes, who spent the past three years working to build support for marriage equality in black churches and communities.  i followed her in the streets of baltimore and the leafy suburbs of prince georges county as she engaged with people from all walks of life about how the push for gay equality was an expansion of civil rights. she questioned how black people, given their struggle to be granted freedoms, could be against granting rights to someone else.  what i saw in maryland was that the activists who were working for marriage equality were untangling the layers of the issue, and they were engaging african americans in a way that had not happened before.  and it was youth    the \"new black\" in the film    who pushed their parents, their teachers and some of their clergy to understand gay rights as an expansion of civil rights.  these conversations helped lead to a very different outcome in maryland in   than in california in    for the first time, the public voted for marriage equality.  these discussions were happening in different homes around america.  even president barack obama cited his daughters, malia and sasha, in his evolution from supporting civil unions to supporting same sex marriage.  it feels like their efforts have now allowed this new understanding about who gets civil rights, and also the perception of gay americans.  and even as there are still more battles to fight    to stop hate crimes, allow for adoption laws and end workplace discrimination    it is significant that the gay community is seen less as a deviant group asking for special rights and more as humans entitled to civil rights,

acceptance speech, the one she wrote as a   year old. she vowed not to open it until she could read it from the stage accepting her award.  sixteen years later, the time may be nearer when palmer can open the envelope. the road has been a long one, starting with her standing on a milk crate as a child so she could sing solos in the church choir. but these days, she is an up and comer in country music    and a rare african american performer in the genre.  palmer acknowledged this week to students in atlanta that some people had told her she could not  sing country because she was african american. but she said, \"when you tell me i ca not  do something, it just makes me want to do it more.\"  palmer told cnn that no one in the music industry had discouraged her based on race but that people who loved her were concerned country stardom might be a tough goal. she said she does not  believe her story is different from any other musicians  \"the music industry is just hard.\"  palmer told students at parkside elementary school that she grew up listening to all kinds of music, including country. \"my mother was a big country music fan,\" she recalled. the family also listened to r b and classic soul, such as sam cooke, she said.  \"i loved the way the country artists wrote songs,\" palmer told about   students, most of them minorities, in an after school program at parkside. she liked the way that country songs told stories  \"i always liked telling stories.\"  \"country girl,\" the first single off palmers self titled   debut album, made her the first african american female in   years to hit billboards country chart, according to country music television.  country music is home to a smattering of well known african american artists. charley pride is by far the most visible, but other artists have dabbled in country as well    the supremes, for instance, and ray charles. more recently, darius rucker, longtime lead singer for hootie and the blowfish, hit the top of the country charts as well.  african americans always have been in the country music industry, said john rumble, senior historian for the country music hall of fame and museum in nashville, tennessee. however, it is  rare for an artist    of any race    to reach the level of stardom attained by pride, who had   records on the country chart between   and  , more than   of them in the top  .  \"some people at the time, and since, called him the jackie robinson of country music, but nobody who followed him has yet reached that level,\" rumble said. \"... hes almost an impossible standard to match.\" however, given ruckers recent success, he is showing \"superstar potential\" in the country industry, rumble added.  palmer lost her mother at an early age but has said her parents love for country music stayed with her. still, she said she doubted she could break into the genre.  \"when you are  a child, you react to something thats familiar and looks like you,\" she told cmt in  . \"and there was nobody [in country music] who looked like me. just being a kid, you do not  see black country singers. so you do not  think thats a possibility for you. you see black pop singers. you see black r b singers. you see black rockers. so you say, \\'if i am  black and i want to sing, then i probably have to sing r b.\\' \"  rumble echoed palmers comments about the music industry being tough on new artists. more than ever, \"it takes a lot of money to put an artist out there on promotional tours,\" creating videos and the like, he said.  rumble said many african american artists probably gravitate to other genres. and, for artists of any race, \"once you are  in the door ... it is  still a matter of catching on.\"  \"there are a certain number of people who are just not used to seeing a black person on cmt or gac [great american country],\" he said. \"it just does not  compute, for whatever reason.\"  palmers family moved to st. louis, missouri, when she was  , according to her web site. she took part in talent pageants there and joined an entertainment troupe.  \"that is where a lot of my country influences started to come out,\" she said in the online biography. \"at the audition we were instructed to pick an artist that we admired and perform some of their songs. i chose leann rimes and shania twain. i was not the one they expected to walk out and sing \\'any man of mine\\' at those state fair shows, but they always liked it.\"  she participated on the cbs show \"star search,\" reaching the finals, and credits judge naomi judds manager with introducing her to the creators of \"waiting in the wings,\" a cmt documentary about african americans in country music, according to her web site. she was also featured on cmts \"most wanted live.\" her music reached terry johnson, president and ceo of   entertainment, who offered her a record deal.  \"you guys are at an age where all the possibilities are open to you,\" she told the atlanta students this week. \"anything you want to do, you can do it.\"  however, she cautioned them that being a singer is not always fun, even though she loves it. \"the best advice i can give you is that this is a job that i do,\" she said. \"... you have to take it very seriously.\"  she fielded questions with a sense of humor, telling them some of her favorite songs  one is bonnie raitts \"nick of time\"  and her favorite instrument    a guitar  \"have you ever tried to push a piano around with you \" she asked .  she told the children that once they start dating, they will find plenty of material    good and bad    to write songs about. she said afterward she enjoyed talking with children and likely would have been a teacher if she had not pursued a music career.  palmer appeared as part of the arts in schools program at the atlanta based threshing floor academy of arts and sciences inc. the organization was founded in   by meisha card, a former special education teacher.  for her part, palmer has said she hopes that one day, the discussion centers on her music rather than her ethnicity.  \"i am  looking forward to the day when the only thing thats being discussed is the album    the actual music    as opposed to my race,\" she told cmt. \"i understand it is something rare, and it is something different, and it is something thats not happening every day. i get that.

married iqbal of her own volition.  one of pakistans leading newspapers, the nation, expressed outrage over parveens killing.  \"the familiar brand of barbaric \\'justice\\' yet again triumphs over the written law of the land,\" it said in an editorial wednesday. \"another case is settled outside the courts. another woman, in search of justice, stoned to death, in the name of honor.\"  farzana bari, a human rights activist based in islamabad, said the real number may be far higher than the human rights commissions official count since many families do not  report the crimes.  she said that in many cases, people outside the family do not  step in to protect the victim.  \"i have  seen in the past people stand around and watch, and do not  intervene because it is a private matter,\" she told cnn on wednesday.  \"i think honor killing is very much part of our culture. it is a cultural form of violence which is quite prevalent in certain parts of pakistan.\"  honor killings happen more often in rural, tribal areas, bari said, but urban cases occur, too.  since many cases are not reported, police have no record and rights groups that try to document what is  happening must do so through media reports and incomplete data.  \"there is no systematic information gathered in pakistan that tells us the extent of the problem,\" she said.  impunity said to encourage killers  and the killers often avoid prosecution.  under an islamic element of pakistani law, known as the law of diyat, the family of a victim is allowed to forgive the perpetrator, according to the human rights commissions report.  \"thus the victims family usually is related to the perpetrator as well, and conveniently forgives their kin, absolving them of the murder,\" the report said. that possibility of impunity has \"continued to encourage others to follow suit,\" it said.  bari gave a similar picture and called for a change in pakistans laws to protect women and the vulnerable.  \"basically, the people have no fear of law because there is a culture of impunity and, as a result of that, people feel free and they can commit such acts outside the courts of justice,\" she said.  she blames such actions also on violent and extremist attitudes which, she said, drive people to act even if they are aware of the potential consequences.  \"i think we must generally reflect on the sick mindset of the society,\" she said.  police said they had arrested parveens father, whose name they gave only as azeem. they said he had admitted to the killing and expressed no regret.  search warrants are out

apartheid era lynching tactic of \"necklacing,\" which was widely used in the townships at the time.  used on suspected informants, the \"necklace\" is a car tire, filled with petrol, put around the

border in search of a better life.  some say the attacks stem from a long standing feeling among locals that the number of immigrants in south africa results in shortages of jobs and essential needs.

trouble brews in faraway lands.  superman   , cover art. artist  fred ray.  c    dc comics. all rights reserved.  sound familiar   more than   years ago, the very first superheroes debuted in the dire times of the great depression and the early years of world war ii. their names became legend    superman, batman  or, as he was then known, the bat man , wonder woman, captain america    and they are  still with us today.  a new exhibit at the skirball cultural center in los angeles celebrates these icons from the golden age of comic books. through a collection of rare original artwork and comics, the exhibit explores how a group of mostly jewish artists created the costumed heroes who came to symbolize the hopes of a beleaguered nation.  \"in the  s, the american dream had become a nightmare, and i think comic books and superheroes in particular provided an escapist form of entertainment that allowed the american public to go into a fantasy world where all the ills of the world were righted by these larger than life heroes,\" says erin clancy, a curator at the skirball.  watch a tour of the exhibit â»  guest curator jerry robinson not only organized the exhibit, hes a part of it. the comic book pioneer created batmans arch enemy, the joker, and named the caped crusaders sidekick robin.  success has many fathers, of course  bob kane, credited with creating batman, has long disputed elements of robinsons creation stories.   \"we were just emerging from the depression,\" robinson recalls. \"superman started in  . batman started in  . so, we were just recovering.\"  robinson says the villains changed with the times. \"the first villains in the comic books were hijackers, embezzlers, bank robbers. it was the era of pretty boy floyd and so forth. once the war came along, we felt a need for more patriotic heroes to fight hitler.  \"in fact,\" he adds, \"hitler banned american comics, at least superman and superheroes. he said they were jewish. little did he know that the creators were actually jewish. ... hitler banned american comics, except one  mickey mouse, which was his favorite.\"  one of the highlights of the collection is robinsons original sketch for the joker. \"my first thought was that a villain who had a sense of humor would be different and memorable,\" he says. \"so, i am  thinking of a name for a villain that has a sense of humor. i thought of \\'the joker\\' as a name, and as soon as i thought that, i associate it with the playing card, as my family had a tradition of champion playing; my brother was a contract champion bridge player. there were always cards around the house.  \"so i searched, and luckily it had the typical image of the joker, which came out of a tradition in europe. this was an important element. throughout history, we had court jesters, clowns, and so this was an iconic image that was also very useful.\"  in our own times, the public is turning to costumed heroes again in record numbers. movies based on comic books are box office leaders; comic books themselves remain a strong and growing industry.  \"i think the comic book superhero came out of a context in which the political, social and economic realties were a little tough,\" clancy says, \"and we can certainly relate to those realities now in our own day. i think the resurgence of popularity of superheroes can be attributed to that.\"  last year, audiences made \"the dark knight\" the second highest grossing film of all time. the late heath ledger, who won a best supporting actor oscar for his performance as the joker in that film, spoke with robinson before he died.  \"i was flattered to hear from him that he based the whole concept of the jokers persona and rationale on our first concept of the joker,\" robinson says.  with the box

smoke and mirrors to deny the truth while congress continues to come up short on critical legislation.  so now, the president is not waiting another minute to make real progress. he is taking action.  on tuesday, president barack obama continued his \"year of action\" by signing two new executive orders to strengthen enforcement of equal pay laws where congress has so far failed to act.  he also challenged the senate to \"start making this right\" by passing the paycheck fairness act when it comes up for a vote on wednesday. the senate has tried twice, but the act was blocked by a handful of stubborn republicans.  but even before the ink was dry on his executive orders, wage gap deniers were trotting out the same old tired arguments we have  heard for years.  rationalizing or outright denying that pay inequity exists, and dismissing the equal pay push as a political ploy designed to distract from other, \"real\" issues.  yet for millions of women struggling on the brink of poverty, the wage gap is all too real.  despite increasing education and greater professional success, women in the aggregate still make less than men  on average,   cents on the dollar, and even less if you are black or latina.  this persistent pay gap has real implications for women and their families, especially when    of our nations households with children rely on women as a primary or sole source of income.  that   cent disparity means a yearly wage gap for women of more than   , .  and what does that translate into  on average, working women in the united states can afford   fewer weeks of food for their families,   fewer months of rent, and more than  ,  fewer gallons of gas per year as compared to men.  it is  not surprising then that polls rank equal pay for equal work as a top issue for women across the country.  more people prefer a male boss, but gender gap is narrowing  but like a bad magician, the naysayers are trying to use smoke and mirrors to fool us into believing the problem is just an illusion.  they say the wage gap is a myth, based on anecdotes, not data.  they say theres no need for new laws, because it is  already illegal to discriminate. any differences that remain, they say, can be explained away by personal choices.  while it is  true the wage gap is due to a combination of factors, study after study has shown the wage gap â\\x80\\x94 as much as    of it â\\x80\\x94 holds true even when we control for factors such as education level, profession or position.  it cannot be fully explained by personal choices, and can be attributed in some measure to overt or unintentional gender based discrimination.  the gap manifests out of the gate and only widens over time.   a   report from the american association of university women, \"graduating to a pay gap,\" made an \"apples to apples\" comparison of college educated women and men working full time one year out of school.  after controlling for college major, occupation, hours worked per week, economic sector, and other factors, women still made    less than what their male counterparts made.  and in an earlier report, the association found that   years after graduation, the unexplained pay gap widened to   .  indeed, womens wages are lower in nearly all occupations    doctors, lawyers, even low wage workers.  and this is true regardless of whether the job is one performed predominantly by men, predominantly women, or an even mix of both.  what millennial women want now  thats why we still need congress to act, to pass the paycheck fairness act to ensure that all employers are held to the standards embodied in tuesdays executive actions.  this week congress has an opportunity to go from its standing ovation for equal pay at the state of the union to really standing up for women.

told reporters she was pushing her baby in a stroller in broad daylight when two teenagers approached her. one demanded money and pointed at her what west first thought was a fake gun. but he fired at her, missing her head and hitting her in the leg, west said, and then the teen shot her baby in the face.  both of the suspects were charged with murder last week, and made their first appearance in court monday.  wearing an orange jumpsuit, his hands and feet shackled, the   year old listened as glynn county judge timothy barton read him his miranda rights. the younger suspect is not being

said, but it was too late. her son died.  \"i will  never hear his first word,\" west said.  babys death marks  nd time georgia mom loses a son to violence  west has said she has no doubt that authorities have her babys killer in custody  \"it is  definitely him.\"  \"i just hope, you know, that the shooter dies. i mean, i had to watch my baby die and i want him to die. a life for a life,\" she said.  immediately after the shooting, detectives searched her home for a gun and conducted gun residue tests on both her and the babys father, west said, adding that the tests were negative and the search did not turn up a gun.  citing the ongoing investigation, police spokesman todd rhodes declined to comment when asked about the search and those tests.  west also said she gave a detective a jacket she was wearing at the time of the shooting. she told police she was grabbed or shoved briefly by the suspected shooter, and they hope to lift a fingerprint off the jacket, she said.  this is not  the first time west has lost a son to violence.  her   year old son was stabbed to death in   in new jersey, she said.  \"this is the second child that people have taken from me in a tragic

house republican, in the wake of a firestorm of criticism surrounding his   speech to a white supremacist group.  scalises position as house majority whip has been thrown into doubt by the revelation, and the congressman had been calling members to gauge the level of support he had from his party, according to a senior house republican source.  but house speaker john boehner, in a statement issued tuesday afternoon, said scalise has his \"full confidence\" as whip.  \"more than a decade ago, representative scalise made an error in judgment, and he was right to acknowledge it was wrong and inappropriate.  like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, i know steve to be a man of high integrity and good character.  he has my full confidence as our whip, and he will continue to do great and important work for all americans,\" he said.  his message came shortly before a similar message of support from house majority leader kevin mccarthy.  the controversy surrounding scalises address to a group founded by former grand wizard of the ku klux klan david duke had become a major distraction for boehner and his leadership team since the story drew national attention on monday.  the fallout  what you need to know  in a statement issued tuesday, scalise said he spoke to the group while he was barnstorming the district to build support for a piece of legislation â\\x80\\x94 and that speaking to them was a \"mistake i regret.\"  \"one of the many groups that i spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views i wholeheartedly condemn. it was a mistake i regret, and i emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views groups like these hold,\" he said in the statement.  \"i am very disappointed that anyone would try to infer otherwise for political gain,\" he added, and decried the groups \"hateful bigotry.\"  the statement did not address how much scalise knew about the group at the time of the speech.  duke himself has said he does not  know scalise. dukes former campaign manager, who said he organized the event, also said the congressman likely was not  aware of the controversial history of his group.  however, a roll call report from   suggests scalise knew duke well, and was critical of his beliefs. at that time, both were considered potential contenders in a house special election, and scalise panned him in comments to the paper.  \"the novelty of david duke has worn off,\" scalise said. \"the voters in this district are smart enough to realize that they need to get behind someone who not only believes in the issues they care about, but also can get elected. duke has proven that he ca not  get elected, and thats the first and most important thing.\"  in a coordinated move tuesday,  boehner and mccarthy issued statements supporting scalise within minutes of scalises new statement. there was frustration, according to the aides, that scalises initial statement, in which he blamed sloppy staff work for his appearance before the group in  , made it appear he was not  taking full responsibility for the incident and moving to get it passed him.  it is unclear at this point how much blowback scalise will get from rank and file republicans, and that might now be fully visible until lawmakers return to work next week after digesting the unfolding situation. while the only public expressions from republicans to this point have been supportive, the aides predicted scalise still needs to work hard in the days ahead to maintain the confidence of his colleagues.  critics of scalise have been bipartisan, but so have his defenders. hes received strong support from louisiana politicians, with african american rep. cedric richmond â\\x80\\x94 the states only democratic house member â\\x80\\x94 defending him from charges of racism.  \"i do not  think steve scalise has a racist bone in his body,\" richmond told the new orleans times picayune. \"steve and i have worked on issues that benefit poor people, black people, white people, jewish people. i know his character.\"  but national democrats have pounced on the episode, and as boehner remained silent on the issue for most of tuesday, ramped pressure on house republican leadership to weigh in  house minority leader nancy pelosis spokesman, drew hammill, said the news of scalises speech is \"deeply troubling\" for a gop leader, but also declared that \"actions [of the house gop caucus] speak louder than whatever\" scalise said during the forum.  \"just this year, house republicans have refused to restore the voting rights act or pass comprehensive immigration reform, and leading republican members are now actively supporting in the federal courts efforts by another known extremist group, the american center for law and justice, which is seeking to overturn the presidents immigration executive actions,\" he said in a statement.  the democratic congressional campaign committee issued a scathing statement charging scalise \"chose to cheerlead for a group of kkk members and neo nazis at a white supremacist rally\" and slamming house leadership for their silence on the development.  \"while david duke defends scalise, speaker boehner and leader [kevin] mccarthy are refusing to condemn scalises choice of allies,\" said democratic congressional campaign committee national press secretary josh schwerin.  schwerin said the incident made it \"clear their leadership has a history of embracing anti semitic, racist hate groups.\"  according to an agenda for the event and notes attendees posted afterward, scalise appeared at the national/international euro workshop on civil rights, a white nationalist organization founded by david duke, a former grand wizard of the ku klux klan.  the appearance was first reported on sunday on cenlamar.com, a louisiana politics blog run by lamar white jr.  but scalise vehemently disavowed the groups beliefs in his interview with the times picayune, and said he \"spoke to any group that called\" â\\x80\\x94 comparing it, as an example, to the league of women voters, a nonpartisan group known for helping to register new voters.  \"when you look at the kind of things they stand for, i detest these kinds of views. as a catholic, i think some of the things they profess target people like me. at lot of their views run contradictory to the way i run my life,\" scalise added.  scalise also suggested the appearance was in part due to staffing issues.  \"i had one person that was working for me. when someone called and asked me to speak, i would go. i was, in no way, affiliated with that group or the other groups i was talking to.\"  cnn has learned that the staffer at the time was cameron henry, who currently holds scalises former state house seat. henry rushed cnn off the phone monday night and declined to discuss the situation, but did not deny his work for the congressman.  henrys brother, charles henry, is scalises current chief of staff. neither responded to requests for comment on tuesday.  the controversy comes just days before republicans take full control of congress with house majority whip scalise poised to play a key role in shepherding through conservatives\\' legislative priorities.  but even conservatives have expressed frustration with scalise, who they believe has not  stood strong on their priorities â\\x80\\x94 pointing most recently to his vote for the government funding measure that drew heavy opposition from conservatives because it did not  address president obamas immigration executive action.  some, however, expressed support for him tuesday. rob maness, the former louisiana senate candidate backed by the tea party, has been named as a potential primary challenger to scalise but backed him in a statement to cnn.  \"as congressman scalise has already conceded   attending this event was a mistake.  i think we are all currently taking him at his word that this was an isolated incident that happened some   years ago,\" maness said.  he added that if thats true, \"this is clearly an orchestrated attack designed to distract\" from the real issues, including \"fighting back against president obamas executive amnesty, correcting a weak and feckless foreign policy and stopping the massive expansion of government growth and spending.\"  more broadly, however, the establishment silence has infuriated conservatives still smarting over their loss in the mississippi senate race, when their chosen candidate, state sen. chris mcdaniel, was narrowly defeated by sen. thad cochran after establishment republicans lodged racially charged attacks against him.  mcdaniel came under heavy fire from establishment republicans for being billed as a headliner for a rally alongside a white nationalist, though he never ultimately attended the rally. in an email to cnn, mcdaniel said that \"of course there is a double standard for the gop establishment.\"  he noted that former mississippi gov. haley barbour \"has a long history of despicable comments, some of them overtly racist,\" pointing to a politico article outlining some of the more salacious.  \"and yet, he receives a free pass from establishment politicians because of his perceived influence.  all the while, others are forever tarnished for less serious deeds,\" mcdaniel said.  he added  \"the establishment wings of both parties are more hypocritical than fair, seeking to crush anyone    friend and foe alike    who would threaten their hold on power.\"  politicians in scalises home state of louisiana rallied to his defense on monday, however, saying they do not  believe he agrees with the white supremacist groups ideology.  \"i know congressman scalise to be a good man who is fair minded and kindhearted. i am  confident he absolutely rejects racism in all its forms,\" louisiana gov. bobby jindal said in a statement.  but scalises alleged appearance at the event drew a harsh rebuke from erick erickson, the conservative redstate.com blogger and former louisiana resident who asked of the congressman  \"how do you not know  how do you not investigate \"  \"how the hell does somebody show up at a david duke organized event in   and claim ignorance \" erickson wrote in a post monday.  he said trent lott    the former senate majority leader who was driven from his post after praising strom thurmonds   segregationist presidential campaign    lost his gig \"for something less than this\" in  .  and he pointed to republicans who hit mississippi senate candidate chris mcdaniel in   for attending events hosted by the sons of confederate veterans and for making plans to attend a rally where he was billed along with a white nationalist.   highlight  house speaker john

the house on tuesday', 'on tuesday, three american . trained scientists won the nobel prize in physics, for finding definitive evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating.  their discovery did not fit any existing theory, so it had mind blowing implications for our understanding of the physical world. at the same time, it is  relatively easy to explain to nonspecialists. so fasten your seat belts for a quick tour of this frontier of knowledge  what was the actual discovery, why is it important, and what does it mean for our world   flash back to the  s, when two independent research teams set out to \"weigh\" the universe    one led by saul perlmutter, a young physicist at the lawrence berkeley laboratory, the other by  a harvard professor of astronomy, bob kirshner, with former graduate student brian schmidt, now at the australia national university, and then graduate student adam riess, now a senior astronomer at the space telescope science institute and the johns hopkins university.  these astrophysicists knew the universe was a vast, mostly empty space, dotted with galaxies of stars in a thin sea of atoms. thanks to work   years earlier by edwin hubble  after whom nasas space telescope is named , they also knew the universe has been expanding for billions of years. like all astronomers, they expected the expansion to be slowing due to the pull of gravity between galaxies and other matter.  it is  pretty simple  the more stuff in the universe, the greater the gravitational \"braking\" of the expansion. so, the nobel prize winning experiments were designed to measure the rate of deceleration of the expansion, and thus the total amount of material in the universe.  what could go wrong  after all, gravity was the only known force that could play a role. both teams measured the distances to supernovae in distant galaxies, expecting they would be closer to us than if there were no gravity at all.  imagine the shock when the data indicated the expansion was speeding up. supernovae appeared to be more distant    fainter    than if the expansion speed were unchanging.  what   the accelerating rate of expansion signaled that gravity, a force we have known about and loved since the first apple fell from a tree, is a paltry thing compared to some new, utterly unknown, energy field that pushes galaxies apart.  we call this new thing \"dark energy\"    signifying the energy that appears to push outward, with the adjective \"dark\" signifying that we know nothing whatsoever about its nature.  moreover, in  , nasas wmap cosmology satellite showed convincingly that dark energy is the dominant constituent of the universe.  this stuff was not  predicted by any physics theory and was completely unknown until the nobel prize winning teams of astronomers and physicists made their measurements    yet there is more of it than anything else in the universe. more than the atoms that make up you and me and our earth, more than the hydrogen and helium that pervades the universe, more than the unknown dark matter particles that cause attractive gravity and allow galaxies to form in the first place. whatever it is, it is  teaching us something utterly new about how matter and space and time behave. a fundamentally new physics theory is needed.  the fact is, dark energy is the biggest mystery in science. it has driven a huge amount of research in the past decade, and was a key driver in last years \"new worlds, new horizons\" report from the national academies of science, which prioritized future astronomy and astrophysics projects. making better measurements of the properties of dark energy was very high on the list, using the james webb space telescope, now nearing completion, as well as an infrared optical space telescope to be built in the coming decade.  both teams measured the expansion rate using supernovae, which are stupendous explosions at the end of a stars fuel burning life. astronomers know that a certain type of supernova always emits roughly the same amount of light, meaning it is a \"standard candle\" that can be used to indicate distance. fainter supernovae would be farther away, and brighter ones would be closer. to make their measurements of supernovae, the teams used telescopes around the world and in space, most run by the national science foundation and nasa.  a supernovas spectrum  how light is distributed across the blue green yellow red optical spectrum  reveals the speed with which it is receding from us due to the expansion of the universe. you have  probably noticed how the tone of a siren changes as it moves toward or away from you, and that the change is larger the faster the vehicle moves. light emitted from supernovae shows the same kind of frequency shift, so its speed can be measured very accurately.  one more ingredient was essential for the experiment  the ability to look back in time. it takes a very long time for light to travel to us from these supernovae, which are rare occurrences in distant galaxies. light from a nearby supernova might take hundreds of thousands of years to reach us, while light from the distant ones sought by the perlmutter and schmidt riess kirshner teams travels for billions of years. this means that looking at supernovae or galaxies at different distances maps the expansion history of the universe    that is, the rate at which it was expanding at different times in the past. measuring the change in expansion speed    the deceleration    was the experimenters\\' goal.  instead the perlmutter and schmidt riess kirshner teams found the expansion was accelerating    as unexpected as seeing a ball fall upward when you drop it.  new data were critical to the bizarre new picture. adam riess, using the hubble space telescope to measure extremely distant supernovae, showed that earlier in the universe gravity was actually winning over dark energy    that is, the initial big bang expansion of space was slowing down. later, as galaxies moved farther apart, the attractive force of gravity between them weakened, and dark energy, which seems to be a constant property of space itself, took over. in todays universe,  .  billion years after the big bang, gravity is far weaker than dark energy. so riess\\' discovery clinched it  alternative explanations for the original discovery would not have shown this evolution from gravity dominated to dark energy dominated space.  astrophysicists are hot on the trail of dark energy. a fellow physics professor asked me, following yales leigh page prize lecture on dark energy by saul perlmutter, one of the nobelists, \"does not  this just keep you up at night, wondering what this stuff could be \" it is  keeping a lot of us up at night.  what does this discovery mean for the rest of the world, for people not engaged in figuring out the laws of nature  dark energy does not directly impact our lives, at least not now. our galaxy has billions of years to go before dark energy could be strong enough to rip it apart.  events move slowly on universe al time.  but if history is any guide, understanding the physics of particles, space and time has proved incredibly valuable time and time again. much of the technological innovation that drives our economy today is derived from physics discoveries decades ago, according to the   \"gathering storm\" report from the national academies of science.  the development of the quantum mechanics theory of matter in the  s led to the electronics in todays computers, industrial and household electronics, from your ipod to your toaster. diagnostic imaging used to discover cancers or other disorders has its roots in the scattering of light and particles by matter, as studied by physicists using particle accelerators. astronomers led the development of electronic imaging devices which are now used widely in digital cameras. airport x ray scanners were built by a company run by astronomers interested in detecting x rays from stars and galaxies. the list goes on and on.  when brian schmidt became an expert on supernovae, he was thinking about how stars explode, not a nobel prize. when adam riess started graduate school, he was thinking about how the cosmos evolved to the present day. when saul perlmutter persuaded his laboratory to do his supernova experiment, he wanted to weigh the universe. when bob kirshner attracts hundreds of students to his astronomy classes at harvard, he teaches them about distant objects and events that seem impossibly remote from our daily lives.  but their passion for science led to a nobel prize worthy discovery. it reminds us that the united states remains one of the leaders in cutting edge scientific research and the training of future scientists. this discovery has challenged our very best theorists and attracted clever young people to science. and some day far in the future, understanding how dark energy could be a property of empty space throughout the universe may well have a profound impact on how we live back here on earth.   highlight  three american . trained scientists won the nobel prize in physics last week

and injuries will surely mount.  every year in the united states alone, an average of just over   people lose their lives on the slopes as a result of accidents in skiing and snowboarding, according to statistics compiled by the american . national ski areas association.  they are sobering figures and often trotted out when a high profile celebrity such as actress natasha richardson, the victim of a tragic accident in canada in  , is involved.  this was drawn into sharp focus again when claude nobs, the   year old founder of the montreux jazz festival, died thursday in a lausanne hospital following an accident on christmas eve.  even elite level athletes are not immune to the dangers and in the past year world cup ski cross racer nik zoricic and fellow canadian world championship winning freestyle skier sarah burke, have lost their lives.  regine cavagnoud of france was the last leading alpine racer to be killed in   and while there have been no deaths since then in alpine skiing world cup or olympic competition, there have been numerous sickening crashes.  calculated risk  austrias mathias lanzinger lost control in a mens world cup downhill at kvitfjell in norway in   and had to have his left leg amputated below the knee.  to an extent, that must be a calculated risk for the professionals because competitors in the olympics or world cup push themselves to the limit at incredible speed or attempting dangerous flips and turns.  however, nearly every amateur skier will have a tale of someone whose alpine adventure has unfortunately ended up with a stay in the resort medical facility, flying back home with a leg in plaster with months of rehabilitation in prospect.  over christmas, ryder cup golfer miguel angel jimenez fell victim to a skiing accident, breaking his leg in the spains sierra nevada mountains and wrecking the early part of his   season.  but are winter sports really any more dangerous than other activities and what measures can be taken to cut down on the risks  .  mike langran, is a scottish doctor who specializes in skiing safety and related issues and runs a dedicated website which gives advice and updates on the latest developments.  he is also the president of the international society for skiing safety  isss  and a director of the scottish snow sports safety study.  bad press  langran is adamant that skiing gets a bad press when it comes to perceptions about safety and quotes international statistics, collated by the isss, to back up his claim.  \"for snow sports, the average injury rate is     per   participants on any one day. compare that to an average game of soccer or rugby where perhaps the same number, or more are injured out of a much smaller number of players,\" he told cnn.  the most typical winter sports accidents would involve knee sprains, head injuries and shoulder, wrist and lower leg injuries, according to figures on his website.  \"with regard to fatalities, in the american . during the past   years, about  .  people have died skiing/snowboarding per year on average. during the  /  season,   fatalities occurred out of the  .  million skier/snowboarder days reported for the season.  \"the rate of fatality converts to  .  per million skier/snowboarder visits. although it is  not directly comparable, in the united states in  ,  ,  people drowned while swimming in public areas and   died while bicycle riding,\" langran added.  world governing body fis  federation internationale de ski  is only too aware of the potential dangers for leisure skiers and has produced its top   tips for safety on the slopes.  fis has recommended the use of helmets on the slopes since  , but their use remains voluntary, despite the type of accident which befell richardson.  however, some travel insurance companies now insist they are worn otherwise claims by injured skiers could be invalidated.  helmet use  \"i always recommend skiers and snowboarders to wear an appropriate helmet,\" said langran.  \"although i do not  believe the overall risk is high enough to mandate their use. snowboarders, especially beginners, should also think carefully about using wrist guards to reduce the chances of a wrist injury.  \"we know that on average snowboarding has an injury rate about twice that of alpine skiing    mainly due to those wrist injuries amongst beginner snowboarders falling onto outstretched hands,\" he added.  at the elite end, where speeds and the degree of daring are breathtaking, helmets are compulsory, but they cannot always prevent the tragedies which befell zoricic and burke.  the fis congress in may   promised urgent action to investigate the area of competitor safety, particularly in ski cross where four competitors start at the same time and battle it out over a course involving jumps and steep turns.  council member michel vion was appointed to chair a newly appointed ski cross working group, which was composed of experts with a wide range of experience across the ski disciplines.  he had an added remit to \"leverage cross discipline expertise in safety matters, notably with alpine skiing and ski cross in mind,\" read a report on the official fis website.  \"safety is our utmost focus but ours is a sport in which some risk always remains,\" fis spokesperson riikka rakic told cnn.  good advice  improvements to equipment have led to reductions in injury rates, for instance the introduction of quick release mechanisms dramatically cut the number of lower leg fractures, while smarter ski design is helping the downward injury trend in the alpine disciplines, according to isss statistics.  but with improved protection from equipment such as ski body armor, is there a danger of being lulled into a false sense of security and to attempt something above your ability level   \"my bottom line is    if you would not  do the trick without the kit, think very carefully about attempting it with the kit,\" said langran.  it would appear to be good advice and he elaborates for the benefit of beginners taking to the piste for the first time.  \"take your time to gain experience on the slopes. get professional instruction but do not  be tempted to try too much too soon, especially if encouraged by more experienced friends.  \"read and follow the fis rules. use the best equipment you can, wear a helmet whenever possible and, if you are  a snowboarder, get yourself a pair of good quality wrist guards,\" he emphasized again.  with an estimated   million skiers and   million snowboarders in the world today, there are plenty of people who would do well to heed this advice and his overall message is that responsible participants have nothing more to fear on the slopes in comparison to other sporting activities.   highlight  fis has top   rules for skiing safety on the slopes   highlight  world governing body recommends use of helmets   highlight  two canadian world cup competitors lost their

tuesday at the indian point nuclear plant on a visit organized by two members of congress from new york who want the plant shut down.  chairman gregory jaczko toured the plant with longtime indian point opponents rep. nita lowey and rep. elliot engel, who have been raising concerns about the safety of the plant following the earthquake and tsunami in japan that seriously damaged the fukushima daiichi nuclear plant.  \"as i have repeatedly stressed to  plant owner  entergy and the nrc, i continue to have serious concerns about several specific issues related to indian point,\" lowey said at a press conference following the tour.  indian point is on the hudson river,   miles north of midtown manhattan.  among the chief concerns raised by lowey and engel is the feasibility of evacuating such a populated area in the event of an emergency.  currently the nrc requires plants to have plans in place to evacuate a   mile radius around their facilities. but, pointing out that the nrc urged americans within a   mile radius of the damaged japanese reactors to leave, lowey said that \"evacuating   million people within a   mile radius of indian point would be a near impossibility.\"  \"the bottom line,\" said engel after the tour, \"i still believe indian point should be closed.\"  jaczko said the visit was a good opportunity to hear firsthand from the representatives about their concerns. \"i think it is  so important that we continue to have a very open and transparent dialogue,\" he said.  asked whether the proximity of the plant to such a densely populated area was sufficient reason to close the plant, as many new york officials have argued, including gov. andrew cuomo, jaczko said he could not  comment since indian point is undergoing a formal relicensing effort right now.  there are two reactors at indian point. one is due to be relicensed in   and the other in  .  jaczko said the agency closely monitors the operation of all nuclear facilities \"to ensure that they meet our very stringent safety and security requirements.\" indian point, he said, meets those requirements.  lowey and engel have introduced a bill that would require the nrc to use the same standards it uses to license new nuclear plants when relicensing older plants, \"including evaluating terror threats, seismic risk, population density and evacuation concerns,\" lowey said.  engel, who first called for the plant to be closed following the  /  terrorist attacks, said, \"if this plant were being built today, in  , i can tell you it would not be sited here in buchanan, new york.\"  lowey said new data showing that indian point is located at two fault lines means the nrc should also evaluate whether a seismic event could affect the power supply or cause the spent fuel pools to leak.  jaczko said as part of relicensing, the nrc looks at the seismic qualifications of plants to ensure that all systems will continue to operate safely. a task force of \"top notch experts\" at the agency is looking at all the challenges and issues that emerged following the earthquake and tsunami in japan, he said.  \"i expect that we will  learn some good lessons, and i expect there will be some changes to our requirements as a result of that,\" he said.   highlight    new york members of congress want nuclear plant closed   highlight  lowey, engel say too many people live too close for evacuation   highlight  nrc chairman praises \"dialogue\"', 'new york yankees player alex rodriguez walked out of an arbitration hearing into his record setting   game suspension on wednesday after learning major league baseball commissioner bud selig would not testify, saying later that hes done with what he called a \"farce\" and an \"abusive process.\"  after arbitrator fred horowitz made the decision on selig, rodriguez slammed his hand on a desk, looked at mlb chief operating officer rob manfred and then at horowitz, and cursed, a source who was in the room in new york told cnn.  the yankees third baseman then walked out, according to the source.  later, rodriguez appeared on wfan radio, which was simulcast on the yes cable tv network, and said he will meet with his attorneys to decide whether he will testify friday, as scheduled.  as of now, if selig does not  appear, rodriguez wo not  either, he said.  one of his attorneys told cnns \"piers morgan live\" that selig needs to answer questions about the suspension.  \"come here, sit in the chair, take an oath, explain your unprecedented, unexplainable decision to make the suspension,\" attorney joe tacopina told cnn. \"what this really is, is cowardice and hypocrisy.\"  rodriguez is appealing his suspension, which mlb levied after accusing him of taking performance enhancing drugs and having ties to the now shuttered biogenesis clinic.  after leaving the hearing, rodriguez released a statement saying he was \"disgusted with this abusive process, designed to ensure that the player fails.\"  \"i have sat through   days of testimony by felons and liars, sitting quietly through every minute, trying to respect the league and the process,\" rodriguez said. \"this morning after bud selig refused to come in and testify about his rationale for the unprecedented and totally baseless punishment he hit me with, the arbitrator selected by mlb and the players\\' association refused to order selig to come in and face me.  \"the absurdity and injustice just became too much. i walked out and will not participate any further in this farce.\"  a spokesman for major league baseball told cnn that the league will continue to take part.  \"despite mr. rodriguez being american et with one of the arbitration panels rulings today, major league baseball remains committed to this process and to a fair resolution of the pending dispute,\" pat courtney said.  the players\\' union said it disagrees with the decision that the commissioner does not  have to testify, saying players have the right to face their accusers.  rodriguez told wfan he invited selig to talk in person in early in   but the commissioner declined.  \"i think they wanted this big spectacle, and they got it,\" he said on wfan.  he said selig has a personal problem with him and is \"trying to destroy me.\"  rodriguez lashes out against mlb commissioner  the suspension involves biogenesis, the former anti aging clinic in south florida that mlb says supplied steroids to at least a dozen baseball players.  rodriguez was one of   players suspended in the biogenesis scandal and is the only one who appealed his suspension. though he was suspended in august, rodriguez played out the   season because he appealed.  rodriguez,  , is fifth on mlbs list of all time home run leaders, just six runs behind willie mays. he would make    million in   if his suspension is overturned. if his suspension is upheld, he wo not  be eligible to return until   games into the   season.  performance enhancing drugs in sports  a rod

president vladimir putin clearly called their bluff on tuesday, announcing steps for his country to annex the crimean peninsula from neighboring ukraine.  president barack obama and european allies had warned such a move would bring tougher sanctions and diplomatic isolation, but there was little immediate response tuesday to putins bold pronouncement in the russian parliament.  the white house announced that obama invited leaders of the g  industrial powers to meet next week on the sidelines of a nuclear security summit in the netherlands to discuss the ukraine crisis.  presumably, such a gathering by obama and his counterparts from britain, france, germany, italy, japan and canada would consider scrapping their annual summit with russia planned for july in sochi, and perhaps kicking putin out of the g  club altogether.  both moves have been threatened, with the g  nations already halting preparations for the sochi meeting.  g  summit in doubt   white house spokesman jay carney strongly hinted tuesday that it would get scrapped, telling reporters that \"preparations for that summit have been suspended, summits do not  occur without preparations\" and \"those preparations look unlikely to resume any time soon.\"  on monday, obama and the european union imposed sanctions on specific russian and crimean officials as part of steps intended to be easily expanded if necessary.  carney said the moves already hurt the russian economy and the ruble currency, and he indicated further actions were coming.  \"you have seen some designations already and there are more to come,\" he said of individuals cited for sanctions.  \"i would not , if i were you, invest in russian equities right now unless you were going short,\" carney advised, in reference to investors speculating on a losing venture.  however, carney made clear that the american . approach focused for now on isolating russia diplomatically and economically.  \"this action    the results of the referendum and the attempts to annex a region of ukraine illegally     will never be recognized by the united states\" and the international community, he said, with \"further actions, further provocations\" by russia leading to \"higher costs.\"  secretary of state john kerry had a more reflective take, telling a town hall style meeting that the administration still hoped for a diplomatic solution \"but today was very confrontational and very triumphalist about something that is a breach of international law, and i think people are deeply concerned about it.\"  biden  crimea was a \"land grab\"  meanwhile, vice president joe biden began a tour of former soviet bloc nations now nato allies by pledging the full support of the strategic alliance against any russian aggression similar to what has occurred in ukraine.  \"our intent is that nato emerge from this crisis stronger and more unified than ever,\" biden said at his first stop in warsaw. \"our commitment is absolutely unwavering and american hakeable.\"  he noted the united states deployed more jet fighters in the region to bolster nato air policing, and he called putins moves to add crimea to the russian federation a \"blatant, blatant violation of international law\" and \"nothing more than a land grab.\"  speaking to reporters at a joint news conference with polish prime minister donald tusk, biden said russia responded to ukraines efforts to realize a more democratic future \"with a brazen, brazen military incursion, with a purposeful ratcheting up of ethnic tensions inside ukraine, with a rushed and illegal referendum in crimea that was, not surprisingly, rejected by virtually the entire world.\"  biden also warned moscow that its political and economic isolation will increase if it continues such aggression, and he reiterated support for ukraine in the form of a billion dollar loan guarantee as well as technical assistance to prepare for elections and support for reforms that will allow the international monetary fund to provide a stabilization package to the cash strapped country.  the vice presidents visit comes two days before european union leaders will meet in brussels for talks certain to include the ukraine crisis.  putin unfazed so far  for his part, putin appeared unfazed by the initial american . and eu steps, telling the parliament on tuesday that russia already races lingering sanctions from the cold war that still exist in practice.  he called the events that led to last months ouster of ukrainian president viktor yanukovych a \"state coup\" carried out through \"terror and murders and pogroms\" by \"russiaphobes and anti semites.\"  the united states rejects putins characterization of the ukraine political upheaval, instead calling it a demonstration of democratic aspirations by the ukrainian people.  underlying the conflict was yanukovychs moves prior to his ouster to align more closely with moscow instead of proceeding with a shift toward closer association with the eu.  opinion  obama ca not  have it both ways on crimea  gop critics at home  at home, obama has come under criticism from republicans who complain an unwillingness

their government. what started as a student mobilization transformed day by day to incorporate professionals, the middle class, and residents of the favelas, or slums.  all are joined in protest against the administration of president dilma rousseff, though their motivations may differ.  some    of brazilians live in the favelas, according to the   census. these mountains of bricks, rising in intricate forms, border the countrys largest cities like sao paulo and rio de janeiro. hospitals, schools, security and an end to police abuse are the principle demands from this social sector.  fatima souza, resident of paraisopolis, the second largest favela in sao paulo, has worked as a maid for   years. she decries that there are no public hospitals or more schools inside the favela. her   year old son dropped out of school two years ago and his return to the classroom has been denied because of lack of room.  paraisopolis is home to  ,  people. the community has the worst schools of the state and local education system    lagging in primary education, behind in literacy and lacking control over the adolescents, according to an index of development in primary education.  the children in the favelas can attend the public daycare centers until they are   years old. the elementary schools run only half a day, a schedule that causes problems for parents who work eight hour shifts.  \\'we do not  have hospitals\\'  \"the only ones who do something for us are the businesses,\" souza said. \"we do not  have hospitals. the only place where we can take our children is the einstein, a community program that is privately financed. when i ask for a visit, they give me an appointment in three months or more.\"  the closest available public hospitals, she says, lack equipment.  \"many say the fight is over public transportation, but why does no one hit the streets so that they raise the minimum wage,\" said fernanda rodrigues, a janitor who spends    a week for

week, the residents of rocinha, one of the largest favelas in rio de janeiro, joined the anti government protests. the immediate motivation was police abuses and security problems in the community.

non governmental organization favelas observatory.  the new middle class  one of the governments accomplishments is that some    of the brazilian population has entered the middle class. of this figure,   million were added to the middle class between   and  , under the government of president luiz inacio lula da silva.  but rising income has not kept people from joining the protests.  according to a survey by the brazilian institute of opinion and statistics,    of the protesters earn more than twice the minimum wage, and    are employed.  close to    of the protesters had not been

a year from the event, half of the stadiums are not ready and it has become clear the need for new infrastructure was underestimated.  \"when brazil was selected as the host of the world cup five years ago, we celebrated. we celebrated because we did not  know that it was going to cost so much,\" said mateos da costa, a   year old taxi driver. \"our leaders should have known that brazil was not in a condition to organize the event.\"  understanding the current social unrest in brazil becomes a harder task every day. however, if there is something that has unified the middle class and the

guts, no heart, no glory,\" tells the true story of muslim female boxers from bradford in the north of england, and how they are using the sport to transcend religious and gender barriers.  the critically acclaimed show    in which the women stamp, dance, shout, swear, punch, and even crowd surf    was partly inspired by ambreen sadiq, a former uk national champion, and one of britains first muslim female boxers.  her journey to success was not  easy    as a victim of bullying at the age of   she found respite in boxing after being introduced to it by her father and brother.  \"i got bullied quite a lot growing up, my dads pakistani and my mums portuguese,\" sadiq told cnn.  \"i got stick from both sides, from white and black people. i felt like i was not  accepted. i used to move schools so many times just to feel accepted.  \"people would stay stuff about how i looked... everyone said thats a boys sport, what are you doing that for  you are  going to look like a man, like a transsexual.  \"i was bullied from such a young age, i felt like it was never going to stop. boxing helped me to control that anger.\"  it was a transformative experience for sadiq    she went from being quiet, having few friends and getting into fights to plucking up courage to start conversations, and thereby build self confidence.  \"instead of punching someone in the face i would  punch the bag,\" she added.  \"if anyone came up to me and said anything i could just walk away from it    whereas before i would  just straight punch them in the face or something. so it is  helped me a lot with discipline.\"  it is  sometimes hard to imagine sadiq as a boxer    her movements are calm and assured, and a kind smile is never far from her lips.  \"boxing has made me the person i am today, and i am  so proud of the person i am,\" said the   year old trailblazer, who is now looked up to by girls from all kinds of communities wanting to follow in her footsteps.  \"i have  had a lot of girls    not just asian girls    coming up to me and asking, how do you stop people saying it is  a boys sport  how can you convince your parents to let you box \"  while boxing for many is just a sport    albeit a violent one    when it comes to women and muslims participating it can feel more like a cause, with sadiq often finding herself explaining her motivation to girls.  \"what is  the difference if a boy boxes or if a girl boxes  when we are  in that ring we look like boxers    we do not  look like a girl or a boy.  \"you come into that gym, you come into that show, you come into that ring thinking i am  a boxer, not that i am  a girl or i am  a boy.\"  the role of nicola adams    the first ever female boxer to win an olympic gold medal    has also been key in the fight for acceptance.  sadiq tells the story of how several years ago her coach alwyn belcher, who also worked with adams, originally refused to train women    that is, until he turned up to coach the gb team  believing they would  be men  only to find an enthusiastic bunch of women ready to work.  \"thats the day he met nicola adams,\" recalls sadiq with a laugh. \"he said from that day he thought girls were better boxers    because they like to listen.\"  since adams\\' success at the olympic games, females boxing once a week increased by    according to a   sport england study, but even the

to be able to do this, and i was just so sad for her. you know there are certain women out there who ca not  do what we are  doing right now.\"  \"i think thats what makes me even more passionate about doing this    we want to give them a voice and give them a reason, so they know they can have confidence to do stuff like this.\"  if women do feel restricted by their religion or gender, ali urged them to take things step by step.  \"go for it, just go for it. i think maybe talk to your parents first, and just tell them mum, dad, this is what i want to do, i want to box, i want to dance, i want to act, or whatever she wants to do.  \"tell them, you know what  its ok what i am  doing, i am  not going to be going out of my boundaries and doing bad things, i am  going to stick to my

schools, police said friday, they believe that children have been poisoned by their school lunches.  at least   students in the southwestern coastal state of goa were treated at a hospital after they got sick at lunch, authorities said. the students, in the third to fifth grades at st. joseph school, have been released from treatment, vishram borkar, a police superintendent in goa, told cnn.  st. joseph school is a government aided private institution, he said.  \"we have registered a case of food poisoning,\" he told cnn, \"and our investigation is on.\"  earlier this week,   students died and   people were hospitalized from food poisoning after a school lunch in northern indias bihar state.  there were two cooks at the bihar school, an official told cnn. two children of one of them    panna devi    ate the toxic food and have died, medical superintendent amarkant jha amar told cnn.  panna devi is not receiving treatment because she did not  eat the toxic food, amar said. she has a third child who ate the food and is improving at a hospital, the medical chief said.  the other cook, manju devi, is also hospitalized, along with her three children, amar added.  earlier, cnn ibn had reported that two of manju devis children had died.  bihar state is one of indias poorest. experts have said the deaths shine a light on food safety in the country and have prompted discussion on how to improve national school food programs amid news that authorities warned of safety problems with bihars school meal program months ago.  on friday, authorities in bihar announced that a new committee would be formed to strengthen food preparation in rural schools. the states mid day meal director, r. lakshmanan, said village communities will also help monitor standards of meals for schoolchildren.  deaths cause protests  the bihar students, who authorities said were between the ages of   and  , started vomiting soon after their first bite of lunch. some fainted.  the parents of at least three children have buried their lost ones near the school    one right in front of the building, according to cnn journalists who saw the burial mounds. an official told cnn that the parents did so out of protest.  after the bihar tragedy, demonstrations sprang up around the area as people angrily demanded answers. one news video showed men apparently attacking a school bus with sticks. others gathered together and held signs. students at nearby schools refused to eat. a group that supplies lunches to schools in the chhapra district of patna was attacked.  it is  unclear whether the children were intentionally or accidentally poisoned. an investigation is under way, and police told cnn that investigators have been unable to find the headmistress of the school in order to question her. authorities were questioning the cook, also hospitalized in the tragedy.  agricultural chemical suspected  officials believe the poison was an organophosphorus compound, a type of chemical that the american . centers for disease control and prevention says is commonly used in agriculture.  it is  a nerve agent related to sarin gas, which is used in chemical warfare, the american . health department says. exposure to a high dose can cause an irregular heartbeat, difficulty breathing, paralysis and seizures.  bihar state education minister p.k. shahi said the children were poisoned by an insecticide that was in the food. shahi said he heard reports that the cook had questioned the quality of the oil she was supposed to use, but was overruled by the schools headmistress.  \"the information which has come to me indeed suggests that the headmistress was told by the cook that medium of cooking was not proper, and she suspected the quality of the oil,\" shahi said. \"but the headmistress rebuked her, and chastised the children, and forced them to continue the meal.\"  according to the indian governments figures, nearly half of indias children suffer from malnutrition of some sort. since a landmark supreme court decision in  , all government schools in india have been required to provide free meals to students younger than  .  bihar state has been working \"to improve the quality and ... try to get good food served,\" shahi told cnn.  \"however, the challenge is still there because the magnitude of this program is so huge that there are a number of challenges.\" he said those challenges are at least partly financial.  \"even though i would unhesitatingly admit that there are some quality issues before us, this is the first incident which has happened in the state,\" shahi said. \"in the past, we have received complaints regarding quality, but the incident of this nature ... has really shocked us    shocked the entire state.\"  mom anguishes over child

about how tough it is to make the decision about hormone replacement therapy.  a   study found hrt made women more vulnerable to health problems including heart attacks and strokes.  \"women say, \\'oh it used to be so simple. now it is  so complex,\\'\" says healy, a cardiologist and former director of the national institutes of health. \"and i tell them, \\'yes, it used to be so simple because it was wrong.\\'\"  this is what she means  before  , it was practically standard operating procedure to put women on synthetic hormones as soon as they reached menopause.  \"we were putting them in the drinking water,\" jokes healy. .  but that turned out to be not such a great idea. a study in   found that hormone replacement therapy, or hrt, made women more vulnerable to heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer and blood clots. in droves, doctors yanked their patients off the hormones.  six years later, healy and others are pleading for a middle ground    a world where doctors do not  paint women with a broad brush, but instead consider the medical needs of each individual woman.  the stumbling block to this middle ground is that patients often do not  know what are good  and bad  reasons to go on hrt. and it is  not just the patients who do not  know. \"a lot of the doctors are confused as well,\" says dr. wulf utian, executive director of the north american menopause society and a consultant in obstetrics and gynecology at the cleveland clinic.  but theres some good news in this hormonal mess. since  , a consensus has developed among the experts about legitimate and not so legitimate reasons for considering hrt. here are the big five legitimate reasons    . hot flashes  if you have severe hot flashes, you are  a good candidate for hormones, our experts say. \"they alleviate the problem by about   percent,\" utian says.  many women    probably about two thirds    have mild to moderate hot flashes and wo not  need hormones, he adds. \"generally speaking, they can get away with layering clothing, avoiding spicy foods, breathing techniques or yoga.\"   . night sweats  \"night sweats are hot flashes when you are  under blankets, so you ca not  get rid of the heat easily,\" utian says.  if night sweats are making you lose sleep to the point you are  dysfunctional the next day, hormones might be a good option. \"some women say, \\'i ca not  live my life like this.\\' thats the woman who should not be denied the hormones,\" says marcia stefanick, professor of medicine at the stanford prevention research center.  stefanick is co author of a new study in the journal of the american medical association showing that women who took a type of hrt called combined therapy  estrogen and progestin together  had a higher risk for breast cancer even three years after they quit taking the hormones.   . sleeplessness  the onset of menopause often gives women sleepless nights    sometimes because of the night sweats, sometimes because of hormone changes. hrt sometimes helps, healy says.   . osteoporosis    sometimes  studies have shown that hrt can cut down on bone fractures for women with osteoporosis, but it is  not for everyone.  \"a younger woman in early menopause who has osteoporosis    or risk factors for osteoporosis    might benefit from hrt,\" utian says. \"older women should use something else.\"  see page   of this nih report for other ways to treat osteoporosis.   women are at high risk for osteoporosis if they are  thin, have a family history of osteoporosis, are lactose intolerant or smoke.   . you feel better on hormones  \"thats absolutely a legitimate reason for taking hormones,\" healy says. \"you very often ca not  measure what makes a woman feel better. but just because you ca not  measure it does not  mean it is  not real.\"  it is  important, however, that women who go on hormones for this reason    or any reason    understand the risks of hormones. \"i tell women, \\'i will  give you the prescription as long as you understand the risks and the responsibilities and come in for regular checkups to see to it that all is going well,\\'\" utian says.  and what are some not so good reasons for going on hrt pills  vaginal dryness and itchiness are better treated with estrogen creams, our experts say. irregular periods should be tolerated, or treated with birth control pills, utian says.  and certainly do not  go on hrt because you think it might prevent aging, heart disease or cancer. the nih study in   rejected those reasons.  if you do decide to go on hrt, you need to keep several things in mind. first, take the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time. that second part is pretty fuzzy. \"the jury is still out. is short term two to three years  five years \" stefanick says. \"when you go back to your doctor for checkups, ask, should i go off it now \\'\"  another question for your doctor  whether you should go on estrogen alone or combination therapy  estrogen plus progestin . each has its pluses and minuses    see page   of the nih document.  choosing the right doctor is obviously of the utmost importance. utian recommends an obstetrician gynecologist rather than an internist. he recommends asking doctors how often they deal with hormone issues. \"some obstetricians are so busy delivering babies, they wo not  be spending much time on hormones,\" he says. email to

toddler, nicknamed yueyue, had been cared for in a hospital in guangdong province since she was injured a week ago.  she succumbed to severe injuries friday morning.  two hit and run drivers ran over yueyue, one after another, after she wandered into the alley outside her fathers hardware store. both fled the scene but are now under arrest.  but there was one thing more shocking than the double hit and run  the seeming apathy by pedestrians, cyclists and driversâ\\x80\\x94  of themâ\\x80\\x94who did not stop to help.  yueyue laid motionless in the street for   minutes until chen xianmei, a   year old woman who collects trash for a living, passed by. she moved her to safety and called for help.  a security camera captured the incident on tape. after the video was posted online, yueyues plight prompted sympathy, outrage and debate in and outside china. how could   people pass by the critically injured child and do nothing  the incident has also prompted widespread soul searching in china about the state of the nations morality and civic consciousness.  why is it so difficult for chinese nowadays to be a good samaritan  there are many possible explanations and many possible culprits.  some blame it on the lack of laws and regulations. others argue it is  caused by the failure of chinas education system to inculcate respect for human life and dignity.  still others blame it on what some call \"jingshen kongxu\", or spiritual vacuum. as the countrys  .  billion people compete to make money and climb the economic and social ladder, experts say, many people find themselves spiritually adrift.  reynard hing, an astute china watcher, cautions against making sweeping conclusions. \"it is  funny how many people read into this, to the point that anti chinese sentiment arises,\" he wrote me. \"this situation is not unique to china.\"  he cites the case of kitty genovese. in  , the woman in queens, n.y. was chased and stabbed to death by an assailant over the course of half an hour while   of her neighbors watched from their windows and did nothing to help.  psychologists, hing tells me, have dubbed this phenomenon the \\'bystander problem\\'â\\x80\\x94the one factor that would predict good samaritan behavior was how many witnesses there were to a tragic event  the more bystanders, the less likely someone will step up to help.  i asked xia xueluan, a socio psychology professor at peking university, about the seeming callousness of the   passersby. one factor is the district where it occurred, which has a concentration of hardware stores like the one yueyues father owns. \" they  are owners of hardware stores originally from different parts of china who hardly know each other. together they comprise a strangers\\' society\\', instead of one made up of real friends and acquaintances, or the \"acquaintances\\' society\\'.\"  xia said the two sub groups are fundamentally different. \"in an \\'acquaintances\\' society\\',\" he explained, \"their relationship is of intimacy, trust and interdependence. in the strangers\\' society\\' it is characterized by estrangement, distrust, and independence. in such a society, it is not surprising to see incidents like this.\"  james feinerman, a law professor at georgetown university likewise cites the changes brought about by rapid urbanization. \"in big cities, where many people have moved in from outside, where there are thousands of newcomers from the provinces, theres a feeling that you are better off just leaving people you do not  know alone,\" he said in a cnn interview.  other observers blame the incident on a breakdown in public trust. a joint survey by three universities in beijing revealed that the root cause of peoples reluctance to help others in need is a lack of trust among residents. only about    surveyed said they still strongly trust other people.  should an elderly person in need be helped  over    of the respondents said \"yes\", but more than    also believed it is too risky; recently in china, there have been several cases of individuals who faked injuries only to sue those who come to their aid.  in  , an old woman in the eastern city of nanjing was injured after rough jostling at a bus stop. peng yu, a young man and fellow passenger, offered help and even took her to the hospital. later, however, the old woman and her family sued him in court, which eventually ruled that peng yu should pay    of the medical costs.  similar cases have happened in recent years.  \"there must be something wrong when it is considered risky to be a good samaritan,\" china daily wrote in an editorial this week. \"apathy and distrust are the last things a harmonious society needs. it is imperative that we find a way to protect good samaritans from being wronged.\"  peking universitys xia xueluan calls this the \"interpersonal trust crisis\". he explains  \"this kind of crisis is highly contagious and could deteriorate due to lack of legal support. as a netizen puts it, it is  not that the good people can no longer be found in our society. it is  that nobody can afford to do good deedsâ\\x80\\x94the price can be too high.\"  days after yueyues tragic accident, millions of chinas micro bloggers are still pouring out their anger and frustration.  \"after peng yus case, if you were the first to find yueyue after the accident, would you rescue her \" netizen yi jingge wrote.  that is a question many in china are now asking themselves.   highlight  a   year old toddler in china died after being hit

russian boy from the moscow airport to the russian education ministry last week said he was \"shocked like a crazy man\" when he realized what was happening.  seven year old justin artyem was sent back to russia alone by the tennessee family that adopted him because of what they said was violent and psychotic behavior.  arthur lookyanov said the child was in \"a good mood\" during the two hour ride thursday morning, drawing pictures and playing with his spiderman toy most of the time. but near the end of the ride, he cried, saying he missed \"grandma nancy,\" lookyanov said.  it was his adopted grandmother, nancy hansen, who bought justin a one way ticket on a united airlines flight from washington to moscow and arranged for lookyanov to meet him there.  lookyanov provided cnn with a copy of his email exchanges with hansen.  \"i am interested in hiring you for a pick up from dme  domodedovo airport  to the office of the ministry of education and science of the russian federation on monday april  th,\" hansen initially wrote to lookyanov, according to the emails.  lookyanov responded with an extensive email that included references for his work as a professional driver for foreign visitors. his fee would be   , he said.  when hansen later sent an email to say she had booked a flight that would arrive on thursday morning, she gave no hint that the passenger would be a child, lookyanov said.  \"i had not big plans so i can meet you at domodedovo,\" lookyanov wrote back to her. \"where are you going to stay in moscow \"  it was not until wednesday that hansen told him his passenger would be a young boy who would be escorted through the airport by an airline employee carrying an envelope with two envelopes inside it, according to the emails.  \"one is an envelope for the ministry of education, tverskaya street,  , moscow,\" hansen wrote. \"the other envelope will be addressed to you. inside will be your payment in us dollars.\"  hansen instructed the driver to take the child inside the ministry and give the envelope to the receptionist.  when lookyanov and the boy arrived at the ministry, he knew something was \"terribly wrong\" when he realized that no one was expecting him. when several women came down to investigate why he was there, they opened the envelope intended for the ministry.  \"i am sorry to say that for the safety of my family, friends and myself i no longer wish to parent this child,\" wrote torry hansen, the adoptive mother.  an angry phone call to the united states followed, with lookyanov talking to nancy hansen first, complaining that he had been deceived, he said.  although the drivers duty was completed, he said, he stayed with the boy throughout the day as they waited for juvenile authorities to pick him up.  while they waited, justin used his pencils to draw \"a beautiful house\" with only one small door. he also drew another boy who he said was logan, his   year old friend, according to lookyanov.  at the end of the day, just before the boy was taken to a special hospital, he gave his driver two gifts. he handed him the united airline wings he was given on the plane and a picture he had drawn while waiting at the ministry.  lookyanov said the experience has left him sad and depressed. but the most difficult thing, he said, has been the negative comments made in the russian media reports, some suggesting that he is partly to blame for the boys plight. he said he wanted people to know that he had no idea his passenger was an adopted child being returned to russia.  the incident sparked outrage in russia and the united states and threatens to bring a halt to adoptions between the two countries.  top officials from the american . state department plan to travel to moscow this week to push russia to allow adoptions by american . families to continue.  \"we were certainly shocked, as was everybody, about the return of the child,\" said michael d. kirby, principal deputy assistant for american . consular affairs. \"we are hoping to work with the russians to continue the adoptions of children.\"  nancy hansen said friday that the boy \"had a hit list of people he wanted to hurt.\" no.   on that list  his american mom, nancy hansen said.  the last straw, the adoptive grandmother said, came last week when the family caught the boy trying to start a fire in the home.  a russian psychologist who visited the boy friday in a hospital in moscow, where he was under evaluation to check his health, described him as \"very friendly\" and communicative. galina semya said she saw no aftereffects of psychological trauma, but \"he does not  quite understand why hes here.\"  when children are adopted abroad, there are normally several stages of adaptation, including one involving cultural shock, in which children can start behaving aggressively, she said. normally, children get over the stage after several months, she said.  in bedford county, tennessee, where hansen lives, a criminal investigation is under way, though authorities said they do not  know whether any laws were broken in the case.  sheriff randall boyce said authorities are still trying to work out a meeting with hansen and her mother. state department officials told him they are not aware of any federal laws broken either, boyce said, adding that officials in bedford county are trying to american eal the boys adoption records to research the adoption.  chuck crawford, attorney general for the district, said officials have not determined whether the case constitutes child abandonment, but if

international airline says that half of the passengers on his planes are \"uncomfortable,\" you might think the carrier in question had a major pr disaster on its hands.  but what alexandre de juniac, ceo of air france klm apparently meant by \"uncomfortable\" was more of the gallic, philosophical variety; that people are just american ettled when they sit on his planes and not even an extra few inches of legroom can placate their metaphysical disquiet.  \"if i give them more space, they will probably be happier, but it will not change their uncomfortable feeling because they are not comfortable in the air,\" he said, talking to cnns richard quest at the recent international air transport association  iata  agm in doha, qatar.  many flying economy class on any airline however might think de juniac is spot on; that flying is just an uncomfortable, cramped experience and the worst part of travel today.  that sentiment is borne out in some recent research by american . pr firm ketchum.  it ranked the public reputation of the airline industry in the united states as only just above banking, the government and the tobacco business in terms of positivity     of people had a negative view of airlines, while    had a positive perception of the travel and tourism business.  in the hyper competitive world of airlines, some have better reputations than others, be that through the power of the brand or genuine, good customer experiences.  for air new zealand    a company that has helped to boost its image by using hobbits and cabin crew in body paint in its in flight safety videos    passengers cannot be thought of enough by airlines.  \"the industry is not customer focused, we are  too fixated on operations,\" said christopher luxon the airlines ceo. \"we do have things to mitigate long haul travel, like our skycouches, but we do have  as an industry  a pretty low innovation rate.\"  many of the in flight innovations are of the variety that make headlines and feed into the aspirational nature of flying, such as new first class cabins. but these are a long way from what the majority of fliers will experience.  and for de juniac the experience is key and currently lacking.  from the moment a ticket is booked on a website all the way through to the moment the passenger arrives at their destination, it needs to be improved, he believes   even if some things are out of an airlines control, such as long immigration queues and poorly equipped airports.  \"the experience of travel is from \\'home to home,\\'\" he said. \"we  as an industry  need to do better.\"  however some question whether or not the industry as a whole needs to do better to collectively to boost its image.  \"the reputation of airlines in america are particularly bad, but elsewhere in the world it is  seen as pretty good because it is still aspirational to fly,\" said rowena olegario, senior research fellow at oxford university.  she also noted how hard it could be for many airlines and those in the aviation business to rally together to boost the idea of flying if many within it lament the experience themselves.  \" they  should be the champions of the industry but what i have  been struck by  while at the iata agm  was how they complain about flying,\" said olegario.  in that respect, there is at least some egalite between those squashed in economy class and some of those who sit towards the front of the planes running the airlines.   highlight  airlines only just more popular than banks, says survey   highlight  industry figures admit airlines must

apple, wal mart and others    have signed a pledge to help the long term unemployed by making sure they do not  have barriers in their hiring practices.  this is good news, but it wo not  solve the problem. the best we can hope for is that the companies now will make special efforts to seek out and employ those who have suffered long term joblessness.  thats a nice start, but feel good gestures wo not  cut it when there are almost   million americans who have been out of work for more than six months. thats a big number. what is  disconcerting is that the current long term unemployment is more serious than in previous economic downturns. data from previous business cycles show people suffering from long run joblessness at worst accounted for about    to    of the unemployed. in recent months, that percentage has jumped to nearly       an all time record   indeed, america is beginning to look like europe. it used to be that long term unemployment in the american . was only a fraction of europes, but the latest data from the organization for economic cooperation and development show that the united states has caught up to many of europes welfare states.  thats not a race we want to be part of, much less win.  so what is  the solution   theres no silver bullet, but economic growth is the single most important key. all forms of unemployment get worse when the economy is weak. but when the economy is booming, the job market gets better for everybody    including those who have been unemployed for long periods.  unfortunately, economic growth has not  proven easy. the recession may have ended officially in the summer of  , but we are  still suffering through a sluggish economic cycle. recent improvements in the overall employment rate are in large part the result of people dropping out of the labor force, and the problem of long run unemployment has barely budged.  to boost employment, we need the kind of strong growth america enjoyed during the reagan and clinton years, when millions of new jobs were created and the unemployment rate fell dramatically. to get there, we need a return to the types of free market policies we got under reagan and clinton  a lower burden of government spending and less intervention from washington.  unfortunately, we have  been moving in the exact opposite direction. under both presidents bush and obama, the size and scope of government has expanded, and the united states    which had the worlds third most free market economy when bill clinton left office    has now dropped to  th in the economic freedom of the world rankings.  we also need to make sure the unemployed do not  get lured into long term dependency. one glaring example of misguided big government policy is the argument to endlessly extend unemployment benefits. that sounds compassionate, but according to economists such policies discourage the unemployed from aggressively seeking new jobs.  there is also persuasive evidence that employers are reluctant to hire people  regardless of any \"pledges\" they may sign  who have been out of work for lengthy periods, which makes the presidents preferred approach of more unemployment benefits akin to an overprotective parent who hinders a childs development.  moreover, obamas proposed hike in the minimum wage would actually counteract any good his pledge would do. why  increasing the minimum wage is the equivalent of sawing off the bottom rungs on the economic ladder. simply stated, businesses create jobs when they think a new employee will help the bottom line. artificially raising the cost of workers    particularly those with marginal skills    is a recipe for creating more unemployment.  the presidents effort to get companies on board with hiring the long term unemployed should be applauded, but he should not  for one second think that it will solve the problem. in fact, too many of his other proposals would serve only to exacerbate the problem the long term unemployed are facing. instead, obama should take a page out of the reagan and clinton presidencies and take action to get to the root of unemployment  economic growth.  the opinions expressed in

eight years ago, he fell off a forklift and the accident caused him to lose his left leg just below the knee. before the accident, reyngoudt had played football, baseball, soccer and ran track for his high school team.  his mother esthi reyngoudt was devastated when she saw her son after the surgery.  \"i just saw my kid without a leg and thought that he would sit around on the couch and he would not  be able to do anything anymore,\" she said. that thought did not last long, since her son was back in the water swimming before he was even fitted for his prosthesis.  \"when i first got my prosthesis, that made a huge difference,\" says reyngoudt, \"i was running out of their office.\"  he has not  stopped running since. it was soon after when reyngoudt took up extreme sports like kiteboarding and wakeboarding. his dedication and perseverance had reyngoudt exceeding all expectation and his talent landed him a spot on the best kiteboarding team.  he now competes solo.  fellow

and freestyle stuff,\" says sexton.  \"it is  motivating for us as much as it is for people sharing the same problems as his.\"  reyngoudt says he does not  view his amputation as a problem. he says

of reyngoudt. \"unless you look close, it is  just a sick picture of a kiteboarder doing a nice trick.\"  walsh did not  look close when he first met reyngoudt. he says reyngoudt must have been wearing long pants when he first started coming into his shop because it took months until walsh noticed his leg. it was reyngoudts talent that walsh first noticed. \"it is a disability, but i do not  think hes by any means disabled.\"  \"i do not  have a disabled parking sticker on my car, i enjoy walking far away from the store,\" reyngoudt says. \"it does not  bother me.\"  referring to him as disabled does not  bother him either, says reyngoudt.  \"i think what every amputee should do is to just take full advantage of what you have. and live life every day as you can and enjoy it.\"  reyngoudt and his friends enjoy spending every minute they can out on the water where he is not  treated any different. walsh says, \"it just takes an extra minute to get ready, but other than that, hes just one of the boys.\"  getting treated like and acting like one of the boys is exactly what his mother hoped for after her sons accident. offering advice to other families of amputees, esthi

political campaigns. opponents of campaign finance reform are having a field day. over the past few years, they have watched with delight as the political parties and supreme court have slowly eviscerated the watergate era campaign finance reforms.  when the supreme court issued decisions citing constitutional barriers to the regulation of campaign finance and independent organizations have figured out new ways to influence politicians, opponents of reform proclaim that the system is better off. at a minimum, they argue that money and lobbying has always been part of this nations politics  there is nothing much to do about it and the republic has survived.  their arguments ignore the horrendous consequences that the influence of private money has on our democratic system.  the opponents of reform turn a blind eye toward the substantial evidence of how the nation is creating an unequal playing field that leaves many citizens virtually disenfranchised even when they retain the precious right to vote. policies such as the tax system are skewed toward wealthier americans, thereby worsening the cycle of inequality from which the nation ca not  seem to escape. as elizabeth warren recounts in her new book, the big banks had overwhelming influence as policymakers handled the crash of  .  at the most obvious level, the constant stories about the influence of money and lobbyists fuel  public skepticism about the democratic process.  the disillusionment caused by the role of money in politics  discourages political participation.  but the effects are even worse than we might think. in an academic article that will make heads turn, the political scientists martin gilens  princeton  and benjamin page  northwestern  have found that as a result of our political processes, wealthier americans have disproportionate influence on the kinds of public policies the government enacts. average citizens matter, but only when they are in agreement with wealthier americans. if not, they tend to lose.  based on a sizable database of public opinion and a study of  ,  policy initiatives over   years, gilens and page report that a majority of americans have little or no influence on the kinds of policies that the government produces. \"when a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organized interests, they generally lose.\" because of the way  our system works, wealthy interests have the ability to block changes that they oppose.  wealthy interests were almost   times as likely to obtain their preferences from policymakers on issues like tax policy as were ordinary citizens.  this is the culmination of changes that have been taking place for several decades. the mobilization of business interests and wealthier americans accelerated in the  s after the role of the federal government had expanded.  as paul pierson and jacob hacker showed in their outstanding book, \"winner take all politics,\" the strengthening and thickening of the organization of the corporate and financial communities in washington resulted in highly sophisticated lobbying operations and campaign donation techniques that enhanced their ability to influence policymakers.  over the next few decades, the result was congressional decisions such as regressive   tax cuts that favored wealthier americans  starting with ronald reagans   tax cut  and economic deregulations that have favored their interests, such as freeing up the financial sector in the  s.  at the same time that wealthier interests were mobilizing to fight against campaign finance regulations put into place after watergate, presidential candidates in both parties, including george w. bush  in  , for the primary elections  and barack obama  in  , for the general election , ultimately decided to reject the publicly financed campaign system that had required them to accept spending limits.  the political parties introduced new mechanisms, such as soft money, to get around regulations while the supreme court dismantled the   reforms through a series of historic decisions.  one of the most damaging results of these changes has been that the political benefits flowing to those with greater financial means worsens the economic inequality that has become such a defining part of modern times.  these kinds of findings should be shocking to americans and offer more than enough evidence about the   dangers we are unleashing through the continued dismantling of the campaign finance laws and the failure to impose serious regulations on lobbying.  for all the arguments about free speech and the need to compete, we should take a close look at   a political system in which most americans do not  have a voice in the process and where, even worse, the outcomes are biased toward certain segments of the nation who can pay to play. this is one issue where the left and right, as well as the slim center, can find agreement.  given supreme court decisions such as fec v. citizens united and fec v. mccutcheon, a constitutional amendment might be necessary if there is to be any possibility of limiting contributions and spending. in the meantime, states might become the central arena for experimenting with new reforms.  unless reform takes place, gilens and page have shown us that the nation is allowing money to slowly undercut the democracy that built america.   highlight  a new study shows that the wealthy have far more influence than the average american   highlight  julian zelizer says study raises disturbing questions about power of campaign

things we learned    . the syrian government is not backing down.  foreign minister walid moallem took to the lectern to defend his countrys handling of the   month crisis, which has spiraled into a civil war.  he accused \"some well known countries\" of pursuing \"new colonial policies\" under the guise of humanitarian efforts, and blamed turkey, saudi arabia, qatar, libya and others for \"arming, funding, training and harboring armed terrorist groups.\"  international calls for syrian president bashar al assad to step down are a \"blatant interference in the domestic affairs of syria,\" the foreign minister said.  approximately  ,  people have been killed in the conflict, according to the opposition, and hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes.  \"while my government is working hard to meet the basic needs of citizens who have been forced by the violence of armed groups to flee their homes, some have sought to fabricate a refugee crisis in neighboring countries through inciting armed groups to intimidate syrian civilians at border areas and forcing them to flee to neighboring countries,\" said moallem.  u.n. debate this year largely centered around the conflict in syria. most of the international community condemns the government there, but ca not  agree on how to stop the bloodshed.  strong united nations . security council action has been blocked by longtime syria supporters, russia and china.   . cuba slams the american . embargo, which has been in place for more than   years.  foreign minister bruno rodriguez railed against his countrys northern neighbor, blasting the embargo that was put in place in  .  cuba attributes much of its economic woe to the embargo, which it calls \"the blockade.\" rodriguez said the policy has caused \"invaluable human and economic damage,\" and accused president barack obama of breaking promises he made in  .  \"the american . policy towards our region, whether under democrat or republican governments, is essentially the same. the promises made by the current president ... were not fulfilled,\" he said, referring to obamas initial pledge to lower some of the barriers in cuban american relations.  in  , the american . treasury department lifted some restrictions on the ability of cuban americans to visit relatives in cuba and send them money, but the united states has kept key components of the embargo in place.  the continued imprisonment of american . contractor alan gross, who was jailed in   on suspicion of espionage, is thought to be the most recent reason why relations are not improving.  \"the united states do not have the slightest moral or political authority to judge cuba,\" rodriguez told delegates.   . the head of the north korean delegation says a spark could set off war on the korean peninsula.  vice foreign minister pak kil yon addressed delegates amid ever present pressure on his countrys nuclear program.  he criticized the united states,

hostile policy towards dprk, the vicious cycle of confrontation and aggravation of tensions is on ongoing phenomenon on the korean peninsula, which has become the worlds most dangerous hotspot where a spark of fire could set off a thermonuclear war,\" pak said.  he recalled the december death of longtime leader kim jong il. kim jong ils son and chosen successor, kim jong un, has taken over as \"supreme leader,\" though the level of his influence on policy decisions remains unclear.  pak also made mention of the countrys recent rocket launch. in april, north korea launched a rocket, which failed less than two minutes into the flight. it said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit, but much of the international community saw it as a cover up for testing ballistic missile technology.  the move destroyed a deal reached in february under which pyongyang agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for food aid shipments from the united states.  \"the united

intelligence agency operatives clandestinely    but with limits. the term \"presidential finding\" is back in the headlines this week because of the situation in libya. a former counterterrorism official with knowledge of american . libya policy said there is a presidential finding authorizing the cia to conduct operations in support of american . policy in libya, including assessing the opposition and determining their needs. heres a deeper look at prescribed covert activities   what is a presidential finding   a finding is a subset of a presidential directive, focused on the central intelligence agency.  according to a congressional research services study in  , presidential directives have been around since the early days of the federal government. \"presidents, exercising magisterial or executive power not unlike that of a monarch, from time to time have issued directives establishing new policy, decreeing the commencement or cessation of some action or ordaining that notice be given to some declaration,\" the study said.  over the years, there have been various directives created, known by specific names and which have a set purpose.  the notion of a presidential finding was established in   during the height of a congressional investigation into allegations the cia was illegally spying on americans and was involved in covert programs to assassinate foreign leaders.  in an effort to reign in the executive branch and the cia, congress passed the the hughes ryan amendment to the   foreign assistance act. the law prohibits the expenditure of appropriated funds by or on behalf of the cia for intelligence activities \"unless and until the president finds that each such operation is important to the national security of the united states and reports, in a timely fashion, a description and scope of such operation to the appropriate committees of congress.\"  how is covert activity legally defined   u.s. law describes covert activity as any secret action taken by the united states in another country to influence that nations political, economic or military situation. the involvement of the american . is not intended to be apparent or publicly acknowledged. the statute does not include traditional intelligence gathering overseas; that is, seeking information within a country and analyzing it for policymakers.  how specific are presidential findings   a former senior intelligence official said presidential findings are written in a way that is \"general enough to allow flexibility, but specific enough to know legally what you can do.\" intelligence officers engaged in the secret task will know that what they are doing has been authorized by the white house and determined to be legal.  a american . official with knowledge of findings said they create a framework for broader actions taken in the future    actions that would require permission from the white house before being done.  a former counterterrorism official said the specific activities of cia officers would be determined by conditions on the ground and would need further approval from the president.  who determines what the covert activities will be   the american . official said it is a \"collective decision.\" the administration determines what the overall policy is and what the goals are, and then turns to the intelligence community for suggestions on how to carry it out. as the official put it, \"you need to look at all instruments of national power\" to carry through a policy.  the former senior intelligence official said covert action is seeking to change such things as the political future of a country, the attitudes of the populace, and/or the economic conditions within a nation.  the fact there is a presidential finding indicates there is a \"much greater involvement\" by the cia in libya, said the official. for instance, in the case of the rebels, the former official suggested some of the things the cia operatives are doing on the ground are \"finding out who they  the rebels  are, what they are doing and what they need\" to be successful. the official went on to say the officers \"might be advising on how to target the adversary, how to use the weapons they have, reconnaissance and counter surveillance.\"  is covert action always secret   whenever the cia is engaged in secret action, the american . wants plausible deniability of the role it may have played    but as the former senior intelligence official indicated, that is not  always the case. for instance, when the cia helped launch the occupation of afghanistan following the september  ,  , terrorist attacks on the united states, cia operatives were in the country coordinating activities before there were any american . boots on the ground. \"things were blowing up,\" said the official, making it difficult to deny the agencys involvement.  the same could be said of the cias use of unmanned aircraft to fire missiles at suspected terrorists in the tribal areas of pakistan. although the cia and the american . government never acknowledge the attacks, it is one of the worst kept secrets. the drones can be seen and heard, and the damage done is publicly evident. but the american . government continues to be mum on the attacks because of pakistani outrage to them.  the former intelligence official angrily said the disclosure of the libyan covert action \"puts peoples lives at risk.\"  \"you ca not  do covert action without the american . showing its hand,\" said the official, adding that will have a detrimental impact on the united states\\' ability to carry out its foreign policy objectives.   highlight  a \"presidential finding\" allows certain covert activities   highlight  the law is primarily focused on the use of the cia   highlight  findings can be both general and specific']}\n"
